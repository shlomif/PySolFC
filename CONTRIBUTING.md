# Contributing to PySol FC

You want to contribute? That's great! Welcome aboard. First of all see [these links](https://github.com/shlomif/Freenode-programming-channel-FAQ/blob/master/FAQ.mdwn#i-want-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-but-how-which-one-can-i-contribute-to)
for general guidelines for contributing to open source.

# Contribution constraints

- The [GitHub Actions CI build](https://github.com/shlomif/PySolFC/actions) and [AppVeyor build](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/shlomif/pysolfc) (which also run the test suite) should pass on each commit.
- Your contributions should be under [GPLv3+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Version_3) or a [compatible free software licence](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses), but please don't put them under the [AGPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License), which adds additional restrictions.
- The code should be compatible with both Python 2.7.x and Python 3.4.x-and-above.

## Adding new games

First of all there is the "Solitaire Wizard" which may be used to generate many
custom variants. It lives in the Edit menu.

Otherwise, the games' sources live under
[the pysollib/games/](pysollib/games/) directory in the repository, and are
written in Python 2.7/3.x and you can try inheriting from an existing
variant [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28computer_programming%29).

In addition to adding the game's source code, be sure to add the game's metadata.  At minimum, you should:
- In html-src/rules, create a rules file for the game in question.  Use an existing rules file as a guideline.  Ideally, each set of game rules should be written in such a way that a non-PySol user can read the rules and know how to play the game with their own deck of cards.  For games that are only slightly different from other games, referencing the more common variant's rules is okay.
- In the pysollib/gamedb.py file, update the GAMES_BY_PYSOL_VERSION dictionary to include the new game's ID for the "dev" key.  If the "dev" entry does not exist, add it.
- If you know the inventor for the game, update the inventor's entry in the GAMES_BY_INVENTORS dictionary in the same file.

## Contributing changesets / patches / diffs

One can contribute changesets either by opening [pull-requests](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request) or merge requests,
or by submitting patches generated by [git diff](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) or [git format-patch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch)
to a developer's email (e.g [@shlomif's](https://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/) ) or uploading it to a web service (e.g: a pastesite, dropbox,
or Google Drive).

# The Release Process

Before publishing a release, please open an issue in GitHub, indicating your intent to do so, to confirm with any other developers if they have any objections, or any WIP features/tickets that should be included in the upcoming release.  It's best to do this a week or two before you plan to actually publish the release.  No responses on this for a couple weeks can be considered approval to proceed.  Releases tagged without verifying with other developers may be removed.

In order to publish a new version, follow these steps:

1. Update `NEWS.asciidoc`.  The release notes should also be added to `html-src/news.html`, along with `templates/index.html` in the website repo.
2. Update the `VERSION_TUPLE =` line in `pysollib/settings.py`.
3. Check the `GAMES_BY_PYSOL_VERSION` dictionary in the `pysollib/gamedb.py` file.  If there's a "dev" entry in this dictionary, change that entry's key to be the new version number.  If there isn't a "dev" entry, ignore this step.
4. Test using `gmake test` .
5. `git commit` the changes .
6. `git tag pysolfc-2.6.5` (or equivalent version).
7. `git push` and `git push --tags` to https://github.com/shlomif/PySolFC .
8. Wait for the AppVeyor build for the tag to complete and scan the .exe using https://www.virustotal.com/ .
9. Grab the macOS installer (.dmg) from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/shlomif/PySolFC/actions/workflows/macos-package.yml) (look for an artifact called `pysolfc-dmg`).
10. Run `gmake dist`.
11. Use [rexz9](https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-computer-settings/blob/567b6ab3f4272ad66bf331536dc80bf58bfff3af/shlomif-settings/bash-aliases/user_aliases.bash#L57) on `dist/PySol*.tar.xz`.
12. Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/pysolfc/files/PySolFC/ and add a folder called PySolFC-2.6.5 (note the capitalisation).
13. Add the tar.xz, the .exe and the .dmg there and mark them as defaults for the right OSes.
