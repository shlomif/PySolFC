# Contributing to PySol FC

You want to contribute? That's great! Welcome aboard. First of all see [these links](https://github.com/shlomif/Freenode-programming-channel-FAQ/blob/master/FAQ.mdwn#i-want-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-but-how-which-one-can-i-contribute-to)
for general guidelines for contributing to open source.

# Contribution constraints

- The [GitHub Actions CI build](https://github.com/shlomif/PySolFC/actions) and [AppVeyor build](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/shlomif/pysolfc) (which also run the test suite) should pass on each commit.
- Your contributions should be under [GPLv3+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Version_3) or a [compatible free software licence](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses), but please don't put them under the [AGPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License), which adds additional restrictions.
- The code should be compatible with both Python 2.7.x and Python 3.4.x-and-above.

# How you can contribute

- [Refactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) the code.
- Add new features.
- Contribute graphics
- Improve the site
- Package PySol for a new package repository or OS, or update existing packages.
- Make a monetary donation.
- [Star](https://help.github.com/articles/about-stars/) or [Watch](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories/) the repository on GitHub

## Adding new games

First of all there is the "Solitaire Wizard" which may be used to generate many
custom variants. It lives in the Edit menu.

Otherwise, the games' sources live under
[the pysollib/games/](pysollib/games/) directory in the repository, and are
written in Python 2.7/3.x and you can try inheriting from an existing
variant [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28computer_programming%29).

## Contributing changesets / patches / diffs

One can contribute changesets either by opening [pull-requests](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request) or merge requests,
or by submitting patches generated by [git diff](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) or [git format-patch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch)
to a developer's email (e.g [@shlomif's](https://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/) ) or uploading it to a web service (e.g: a pastesite, dropbox,
or Google Drive).

# The Release Process

In order to publish a new version, follow these steps:

1. Update `NEWS.asciidoc`.  The release notes should also be added to `html-src/news.html`, along with `templates/index.html` in the website repo.
2. Update the `VERSION_TUPLE =` line in `pysollib/settings.py`.
3. Test using `gmake test` .
4. `git commit` the changes .
5. `git tag pysolfc-2.6.5` (or equivalent version).
6. `git push` and `git push --tags` to https://github.com/shlomif/PySolFC .
7. Wait for the AppVeyor build for the tag to complete and scan the .exe using https://www.virustotal.com/ .
8. Grab the macOS installer (.dmg) from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/shlomif/PySolFC/actions/workflows/macos-package.yml) (look for an artifact called `pysolfc-dmg`).
9. Run `gmake dist`.
10. Use [rexz9](https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-computer-settings/blob/567b6ab3f4272ad66bf331536dc80bf58bfff3af/shlomif-settings/bash-aliases/user_aliases.bash#L57) on `dist/PySol*.tar.xz`.
11. Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/pysolfc/files/PySolFC/ and add a folder called PySolFC-2.6.5 (note the capitalisation).
12. Add the tar.xz, the .exe and the .dmg there and mark them as defaults for the right OSes.
