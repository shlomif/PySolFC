Prerequisites (needs root):

  On a 'freshly installed' Ubuntu 16.04 (32bit), the following
  additional packages had to be installed:

  - python-setuptools
  - javasdk          (ubuntu: default jdk)
  - cython           (ubuntu: cython)
  - pip              (ubuntu: python-pip)
  - pexpect          (ubuntu: python-pexpect)
  - zlib headers     (ubuntu: zlib1g-dev)
  - virtualenv       (python-virtualenv)
  - zip,unzip

  On a freshly installed debian stretch/xfce:

  -> consult script files in directory android/debian.

  On a 'simple' gentoo installation the following packages had to be
  installed in addition:

  - dev-python/pip
  - dev-python/virtualenv
  - dev-python/cython
  - dev-media-libs/libsdl2
  - dev-media-libs/sdl2-image
  - dev-media-libs/sdl2-mixer
  - dev-media-libs/sdl2-ttf
  - dev-media-libs/gstreamer
  - dev-vcs/git
  - dev-java/ant

  and python modules:

  - python3 -m pip install requests --user.
  - python3 -m pip install clint --user.

  NOTES:
  1) This information is supplied to give you a hint, when running into
     problems.
  2) All builds need an working (fairly fast) internet connection and
     6 GB of free disk space.


Build with 'python-for-android' (as user):

  go to the android directory, then

  $ ./mkp4a.init [<sdkdir>] [<ndkdir>]        # prepare sdk and p4a installation
  $ ./mkkeystore                              # if you want to build a release version.

  $ ./mkp4a.debug                             # build debug apk
  $ ./mkp4a.release  <passwd1>  [<passwd2>]   # build release apk
  $ ./mkp4a.unsigned                          # build an unsigned release apk

  The build system will download all required additional
  packages (such as the android sdk and more). Do the first build will
  take a while. All in all you will need up to 6 GB of free disk space.

  If you have Android Studio installed, you may call mkp4a.init
  with optional parameter <sdk-dir> and ev. in addition as
  second parameter <ndk-dir> (if not default) to prevent them
  from downloading a new. (Note that currently android ndk version
  should be less 14, otherwise the build will fail).

  Resulted apks will appear in directory android.

Cardsets:

Cardsets should be installed in ${HOME}/.PySolFC/cardsets/. On an
android device this is equivalent to /sdcard/.PySolFC/cardsets/.
Cardsets must use the bmp image format. Use scripts/cardconv
(on a linux system) to convert them, before copying to the device.

Possible known build issues:

2) for android ndk: needs a Version <=13 (because needs ant support).

3) python-for-android, on downloading recipes:

  ('CA CERTIFICATE VALIDATION FAILED' when downloading python.2.7 or
   some 'recipes')

  Solution:
    Try the download address with firefox. if it works, view the
    site certificate and download (export) it from the browser.
    Copy the resulting *.crt to /usr/local/ca-certificates and
    run update-ca-certificates.
