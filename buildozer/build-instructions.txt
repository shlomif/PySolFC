MEMO:
-----

This is a memo on how to proceed to get an android
app out of the repo.

You should have python and virtualenv installed on
your system. You might need to add missing
packages to your system with your os package manager
and through pip.

Prepare
-------

Move to directory buildozer.

First create and enter a virtualenv and load all
required python modules using pip install.

$> virtualenv ENV
$> . ENV/bin/activate
$> pip install -r pipreq.txt

Then prepare the source package. The script
assembles all necessary files in the
subdirectory ./tmp/. It also includes a minimal
set of cards.

$> ./buildozer.init

Up to this point it should work fine.

Make a debug version
--------------------

Run the buildozer command. Its work is
defined in the file buildozer.spec. Only
minimal changes have been made to the default
setup, to reflect the local situation.

Execution of buildozer needs some time. You
will have to accept a lizense from google.

$> ./buildozer.run

Finally if all worked fine, the apk file is found in
directory ./bin/.

If it fails, set the log_level in buildozer.spec to 2
to get better information on what to do.


Make a release Version:
-----------------------

$> ./buildozer.run release

Without signing information the result apk is a
'release-unsigned' that can be signed afterwards
with jarsigner.

Alternatively signing information could be supplied
through Environment vars. See buildozer and
python-for-android documentatin for further
instructions.


test notes:
----------

1) on a debian testing desktop developer installation
   zip archiver was missing. apt install zip solved
   that.

2) on a gentoo linux recipe pyjnius didnt find
   javac, the java compiler. Added a link to it
   in ENV/bin.

3) built apks worked on android 7 and android 8.
   (no newer devices had been available)

4) on fdroid, that provided a light weight build server
   with debian bullseye the following additional packages had
   to be installed (apt-get):
   - ant autoconf build-essential ccache gettext imagemagick
   - libffi-dev libltdl-dev libssl-dev libtool python3-tk
   - virtualenv wget zlib1g-dev
