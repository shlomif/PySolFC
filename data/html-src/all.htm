are two columns with four general reserves each.  The inner most two
columns are the two Braid stacks.  Each Braid starts with sixteen cards.
When one of the Braid reserves becomes open the card at the top of the
corresponding Braid will be moved there.  When all the cards from one
of the Braids are removed a card from the other Braid will be used.

auto drop enabled and all twelve cards will move there in order.  Four
cards are dealt to each of the ten rows when the game begins.  Press
(d)eal or click the talon to deal the next round of one card to each
row.  The reserve stacks to either side of the foundation will take one
card each.  Cards on the reserves may only be played to the rows.

will play in rank order only, it's helpful to also work on playing them by
suit.
<h1>Ashrafi</h1>
Mughal Ganjifa type. One deck. No redeal.

The rows build down by rank only, no more than twelve to a row.

<h3>Rules</h3>
The cards on the tableau build down by rank regardless of suit.  No more

The layout consists of three rows of playing piles, a row for newly
dealt cards and three free cells that will hold one card each.
<p>
The cards must be arranged in the top three rows as follows:
<ul>
<li>The top row must start with a three and build by suit in increments of three,
<li>the second row must with a two,
<li>and the third row must start with an Ace.
</ul>
<p>
If you clear a space at the bottom it will be automatically filled
with a card from the talon. But if the talon is gone and you clear a space
at the bottom, then you can fill it with any card.  You may move any card
to the free cells from the tableau on top or the rows below, but only as
long as there are cards left in the talon.  When the talon is empty, you
may only move cards from, not to the free cells.
When no further moves are possible, click on the talon for a fresh row
of cards at the bottom.
<p>
You win when all of the suits are arranged in order.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Because of the many piles involved the Picture Gallery requires some
concentration, but it is not too hard to win.

<h1>Baker's Game</h1>
<p>
FreeCell type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="freecell.html">FreeCell</a>,

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
All cards are dealt at the start of the game. To compensate for this
there are 4 free cells which can hold any - and just one - card.
<p>
Cards may only be moved onto cards of the same suit.
<p>
The number of cards you can move as a sequence is restricted by
the number of free cells - the number of free cells required is the
same as if you would make an equivalent sequence of moves with single cards.
(As a shortcut, the computer also considers the number of free piles so
that you can move even more cards as one single sequence.)

<h3>Quick description</h3>
<p>
Fill Byte stacks by matching the goal card's byte value, fill bit
stacks by matching the corresponding bit value.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
When play begins the four left most columns are filled with four
goal cards of different ranks, one from each suit.  The next two
columns to the right are the byte stacks.  They can be filled
with cards of the same rank as the goal card in that row.  The
four right most columns are the bit stacks.  They can be filled
with cards of the same suit as the goal card in the respective
row if their least significant bit matches the corresponding
bit on the goal card.
<p>
Cards from the talon are turned over to the waste pile, two at a
time.  There is only one redeal.
<p>
The only function of the Wizards in this game is to block the
waste stack at the worst possible time.

<br>Gameplay is completely equivalent.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This 52-card solitaire starts with the entire deck shuffled and dealt
out in four rows.  The aces are then moved to the left end of the layout,
making 4 initial free spaces.  You may move to a space only the card that
matches the left neighbor in suit, and is one greater in rank.  Kings are
high, so no cards may be placed to their right (they create dead spaces).
<p>
When no moves can be made,  cards still out of sequence are  reshuffled
and dealt face up after the ends of the partial sequences, leaving a card
space after each sequence, so that each row looks like a partial sequence
followed by a space, followed by enough cards to make a row of 14.

<h1>Braid (Der Zopf)</h1>
<p>
Napoleon type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This game is somewhat harder and requires thoughtful strategy.
<p>
The layout consist of a Braid of 20 cards, two groups of four helper
fields, four braid fields (each showing a picture of a braid), the waste
pile, and the eight foundations.  The first card automatically dealt to a
Foundation sets the beginning value for all foundations, and an indicator
displays the value of that card.
<p>
You choose whether the sequences on the foundations will be ascending
or descending, and your choice is displayed in an indicator.  The choice is
made when you place the first card on a foundation which is not the
already-determined base card.
It must follow suit and must have a numerical value
of either one more or one less than the base card.  Ace is considered one
higher than King, and at the same time one less than Two.
<p>
You may place cards on the foundation from anywhere on the table,
including the end of the Braid.  The eight helper fields can be filled from
the waste pile but not from the Braid or the braid fields.  When you move
a card from a braid field to the foundation, that field is automatically
filled with the last card on the Braid itself.
<p>
In going through the talon, you are limited to three rounds, and an
indicator reports on that status.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
You can use the helper fields to temporarily store cards you expect to
use soon, and you can leave them open until the right card comes up from the
Talon.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
This is a solitaire variant of German origin.
<h1>Double Bridget's Game</h1>
Hex A Deck game type. 4 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the Foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="larasgame.html">Lara's Game</a>
with sixteen rows, one redeal and
<a href="../hexadeck.html">Hex A Deck</a>
variations.  This is the same as
<a href="bridgetsgame.html">Bridget's Game</a>
with four decks and two redeals.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Refer to the description of the deal in Lara's Game.  The differences
are that the cards are dealt to seventeen piles instead of fourteen
and if a dealt card is of rank eleven or over one card is dealt to
the talon.  Otherwise the dealing rules are the same.
<p>
Play is the same as Lara's Game with two exceptions.  The first exception
is that there is one redeal.  When the talon is empty after the first
round the cards are gathered up from the tableau and dealt to the rows
without being shuffled using the same dealing rules as in the first round.
<p>
The other exception is the extra reserve stack just to the right of the
rows and the top foundations.  This reserve stack has the potential to
save a game that would otherwise be lost.  The way it works is this.
When empty it will accept any Wizard card, but only from a foundation.
Once a Wizard has been played on it, it will accept any two cards from
any of the row stacks.  Once played on the stack, cards can only be removed
by playing them to a foundation.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Don't play on the extra reserve stack unless you are sure the
top card will play to a foundation soon.

<h3>Notes</h3>
This game is dedicated to the memory of Bridget Bishop, hanged as a
witch on June 10, 1692 in Salem Massachusetts, U. S. A. and to the
nineteen other victims of that notorious witch hunt.

<h1>Canfield</h1>
<p>
Canfield type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Canfield is played with one deck. The object is to build all four
of the foundations at the top right from the rank of the first card
dealt into there (varies from game to game), all in the same suit.
<p>
The tableau consists of four piles, starting with one card each.  The
cards can be stacked according to the following rules
<ul>
<li> Red cards may be only played on black cards, and black only on
  red.
<li> Only the next smaller card may be played, so that the stacks
  are in descending sequence except when the previous card is an Ace,
  in which only the King may be played.
<li> You may not move parts of a sequence except the top card.
<li> Empty spaces in the tableau will be filled automatically from
  the reserve (the pile below the talon) until it is exhausted.  When
  the reserve is exhausted, the empty spaces can be filled with any
  card.
</ul>
<p>
When there are no more possible moves, click on the talon.  Three
cards will be moved from the talon to the waste pile directly to its
right.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
The auto-solver is hopeless.  Don't believe the hints.  They tend to
be right but it doesn't figure everything out (there may be valid
moves that it won't guess).

played from the foundations.

</ul>
<p>
If you clear a space at the bottom it will be automatically filled
with a card from the talon. But if the talon is gone and you clear a space
at the bottom, then you can fill it with any card.  You may move any card
to the free cells from the tableau on top or the rows below, but only as
long as there are cards left in the talon.  When the talon is empty, you
may only move cards from, not to the free cells.
When no further moves are possible, click on the talon for a fresh row
of cards at the bottom.
<p>
You win when all of the suits are arranged in order.

<h3>Strategy</h3>

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This game is somewhat harder and requires thoughtful strategy.
<p>
The layout consist of 4 foundations in the middle,
8 row stacks (4 on each of the left and right side),
2 reserve stacks (one on each of the left and right side),
and a free cell in the middle.
<p>
The row stacks and reserve stacks grow from the middle and are laid out
open, but only the outer card is in play.
<p>
The foundations build either up or down in suit, depending on the
first card you play there.
They wrap around from King to Ace and Ace to King.
<p>
The 8 row stacks build both up and down in suit, also wrapping around.
Only a single card can be moved, and free rows can be filled with
any single card.
<p>
There is no building on the 2 reserve stacks. Cards can only be moved
to other stacks from there.
<p>
Finally there is one extra free cell that can hold any single card.
But to move a card back from the free cell at least one of the
two "blocking" reserve stacks must have been cleared.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Try <a href="derfreienapoleon.html">Der freie Napoleon</a> if
you have troubles understanding the rules - it is the exactly
same game in a different layout.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Decide carefully if you build the foundations up or down.

Getting a free row stack should be one of your highest priorities.

<h1>Double Grasshopper</h1>
<p>
Tarock type. 2 deck. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The tableau consists of one reserve stack, two Trumps only row stacks,
and nine row stacks.  Twenty-eight cards are dealt to the reserve
stack and one card each to the row stacks.  When a row stack is emptied
it must be filled from the reserve stack first.  When the reserve stack
is empty any card can be played on an empty row stack.  The Trumps only
stacks are left empty and can be played on at will.  The row stacks
build down in rank by alternate colors.  The Trumps can be played as
either color.  The Trumps only row stacks also build down in rank.  They
will accept a stack of cards that contains suit cards as long as the
bottom card is a Trump.  The foundations build up in rank by suit.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
With skillful play and a bit of luck it's possible to sweep this one
without needing the redeal.  The first priority is to empty the reserve
stack.  Once that's done try to keep one or more row stacks open.  Play
high rank cards on the rows and build down on them.  The same goes for
the Trumps only rows.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Arrange the Flower Cards in suit order.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The layout consists of three rows of playing piles and a row for newly
dealt cards.
<p>
The cards must be arranged from forth rank to first in the top three
rows as follows:
<ul>
<li>The first row will only accept the first four suits, Pine, Plum, Cherry and Wisteria
<li>the second row will accept the second four, Iris, Peony, Bush Clover and Eularia
<li>and the third row will accept the last four, Chrysanthemum, Maple, Willow and Paulownia.

<h1>Flower Clock</h1>
<p>
Hanafuda type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This one is for people who want a mindless distraction.  It's a good
way to learn the suits and ranks of the flower cards.  The foundations
build from fourth rank to first, by suits.  Any fourth rank card can be
played on any open foundation stack, but a game doesn't count as a win
unless the suits are in their proper order.  That means Pine is at 1
o'clock, Plum at 2 o'clock etc.  Once a card is played on a foundation stack
it can't be taken off except by undoing the move.  There can be no
more than eight cards in a row.

<p>
The cards in the tableau build from first rank to fourth, without regard
to suit.  The third and fourth rank cards are interchangable.  Any card
can be played on the canvas.

<h1>Grandfather's Clock</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Move cards to the foundations until the top of each foundation is the
clock number for that position. Jack equals 11, Queen equals 12, and
Aces must be placed on Kings.
<p>
The playing piles build down by rank regardless of suit. Only the top card
is available for play, and empty rows may be filled with any single card.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
<i>Autodrop</i> and <i>Quickplay</i> are disabled for this game.
<h1>Grandmother's Game</h1>
<p>
Spider type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Group all the cards in sets of 13 cards in descending sequence
by suit from King to Ace and move such sets to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Just like <a href="relaxedspider.html">Relaxed Spider</a>,
but deal 60 cards face up at game start.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
60 cards are dealt open face in 10 piles.
Piles build down by rank, regardless of suit.
However, sequences that are all of the same suit are preferred
because these are available for further movement.
<p>
A free space can be filled by any single card or sequence.
<p>
The object is to group the cards in sets of 13 cards, from King to Ace
of the same suit. Such groups can be moved to a free space and then off
the game by a mouseclick.
<p>
When no more sensible moves are available, click on the talon. One card
will be added to each of the playing piles (this includes the at this time
free spaces too).
<p>
You may deal new cards at any time.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Grandmother's Game is a complex strategic solitaire game which cannot be
solved very often. A good way to get to a satisfactory solution is to establish
at least one, better two or even more, free spaces to get room for moving
the cards and fit them together to descending suits.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
This is a <a href="spider.html">Spider type game</a> of German origin.
<h1>Grasshopper</h1>
<p>
Tarock type. 1 deck. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The tableau consists of one reserve stack, one Trumps only row stack,
and five row stacks.  Fourteen cards are dealt to the reserve
stack and one card each to the row stacks.  When a row stack is emptied
it must be filled from the reserve stack first.  When the reserve stack
is empty any card can be played on an empty row stack.  The Trumps only
stack is left empty and can be played on at will.  The row stacks
build down in rank by alternate colors.  The Trumps can be played as
either color.  The Trumps only row stack also builds down in rank.  It
will accept a stack of cards that contains suit cards as long as the
bottom card is a Trump.  The foundations build up in rank by suit.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
The first priority is to empty the reserve stack.  Once that's done
try to keep one or more row stacks open.  Play
high rank cards on the rows and build down on them.  The same goes for
the Trumps only row.

<h1>Greater Queue</h1>
Braid type. 4 decks. Two redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the Foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Play is similar to
<a href="braid.html">Braid</a>.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Twenty five cards are dealt to the Braid when the game begins.
The foundations build in ascending suit order from Pine to Paulownia by rank.
Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time and two redeals are allowed.
Cards may not be played from the foundations.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Build sequences on the rows that will play when the correct card turns
over from the talon.  Braid type games require careful strategy to win.
<h1>Great Wall</h1>
<p>
Hanafuda type. 4 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards can be played on the tableau by suits or by rank.
Plum 1 plays on Pine 1, Maple 3 on Mum 3, Pine 2 on
Phoenix 2, etc.  Any second rank card can be played on
any first.  The third and fourth ranks are interchangable
for all suits.  Only first rank cards can be played on the
canvas.  There can be no more than 26 cards in a row.
<p>
The foundations are of two types.  The finish foundations
at the top on the left and right, and the build foundations
on the bottom.  Cards must be played on the foundations by
rank in suit order.  The finish foundations will only accept
cards as a complete set of all twelve suits.  The build
foundations will accept only one card at a time.
The finish foundations will accept three complete sets
of suits.  The build foundations will accept one.  When
all four decks are on the foundations in order, you have
won.  Cards can be moved from the build foundations to
the finish foundations or to the tableau.  They cannot
be moved from the finish foundations.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Since any particular card will usually play in several
different places on the tableau it's probably possible to
win every hand of Great Wall.
<p>
Hint: don't play all your first rank cards on the foundations
until all the cards are face up.

<h1>Ground for a Divorce</h1>
<p>
Spider type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Group all the cards in sets of 13 cards in descending sequence
by same suit and move such sets to the foundations.
The sequence may wrap around.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="spider.html">Spider</a>,
but sequences wrap around from Ace to King,
and no card will be dealt to an empty space.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
50 cards are dealt in 10 piles. Cards are built down, regardless of suit.
However, sequences that are all of the same suit are preferred because
these are available for further movement.
A space can be filled by any card or legal group of cards.
<p>
Sequences wrap around, i.e. Kings may be placed on Aces.
<p>
The object is to group the cards in descending sets of 13 cards of the
same suit. These sequences may wrap around as well.
Such groups can then be moved to the foundations.
<p>
When no more moves are possible, click on the talon. One card will be
added to each <i>non empty</i> space.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
This is my favorite
<a href="spider.html">Spider</a>
variant. Even more decisions, and
with a fair chance of coming out.
The original German name is <i>Scheidungsgrund</i>.
<h1>Gypsy</h1>
<p>
Gypsy type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The eight playing piles in the tableau all start with two
cards face-down and one showing.
Piles build down by alternate color, and an empty space can be filled
with any card or sequence.
<p>
When no more moves are possible, click on the talon. One card will be
added to each of the playing piles.
<p>
You are also permitted to move cards back out of the foundation.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Making heavy use of the Undo key is explicitly encouraged here - you can win
quite a number of games with a little bit of thought.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
Gypsy is my all time favorite - it is probably the reason
that I started writing PySol at all...
<p>
I first met Gypsy almost fifteen years ago in the nice
Atari ST game <i>Patience</i> written by Volker Weidner.
And as there seems to be no official name of
this variant I adopted the name Gypsy from another
game called <i>xpat2</i>.
<h1>Hayagriva</h1>
Dashavatara Ganjifa type. One deck. No redeal.
<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the foundations.
<h3>Quick description</h3>
The cards build down by rank only on the tableau, no more
than twelve to a row.  Only the Rajas may be played on an empty row.
<h3>Rules</h3>
All cards are dealt to the sixteen rows when the games begins.  Cards
on the tableau build down in rank only.  The foundations build up by suit.
Only a Raja or sequence may be played on an empty row.  The four reserve
stacks hold one card each.
<h3>Strategy</h3>
An empty row is somewhat more useful than the reserve stacks.  Try for an empty row.
<h1>Hex A Klon by Three</h1>
Klondike type. One deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the Foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="klondike.html">Klondike</a>
with <a href="../hexadeck.html">Hex A Deck</a>
variations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Game play is like Klondike with the Wizards being wild.  They can be played
on the tableau as any rank or color.  Once a Wizard is played on a row however
that row may become unmovable.  If a Wizard is played in it's proper rank
position the row can still be moved.  A stack with two Wizards can be moved
only if they are both in their rank position and they are not adjacent to
each other.  The Wizards will not move off of the tableau until all the other
cards have been moved to the foundations.  Cards are dealt from the talon three
at a time.  Any card or sequence may be played on the canvas.  Cards may
be played from the foundations.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Keep the Wizards off of piles that contain face down cards.  Once all the
cards on the tableau are face up try to get the Wizards out of the way.  Put
them all on one row stack until the suit cards have been moved to the foundations.
<h1>Hex A Klon</h1>
<p>
Hex A Deck type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="klondike.html">Klondike</a>, except any card can
be played on an empty row and the Wizards (Jokers) are wild.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Game play is like Klondike with the Wizards being wild.  They can be played
on the tableau as any rank or color.  Once a Wizard is played on a row however
that row may become unmovable.  The Wizards have ranks like the suit cards
corresponding to Ace through Four.  If a Wizard is played in it's proper rank
position the row can still be moved.  The rank can be determined by the height
of the hat.  The Ace Wizard has the tallest hat.  A stack with two Wizards can
be moved only if they are both in their rank position and they are not ajacent
to each other.  The Wizards will not move off of the tableau until all the other
cards have been moved to the foundations.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Keep the Wizards off of piles that contain face down cards.  Once all the
cards on the tableau are face up try to get the Wizards out of the way.  Put
them all on one row stack until the suit cards have been moved to the foundations.

<h1>Hidden Passages</h1>
Klondike type. One deck. One redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the Foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="blindalleys.html">Blind Alleys</a>
with <a href="../hexadeck.html">Hex A Deck</a>
variations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Game play is like Blind Alleys.  The rows build down in rank in alternate
color.  Any card or sequence may be played on an empty row.  The Wizards
will play in their proper rank position on the tableau as the alternate
of either red or black.  Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time.
The four suit Aces are dealt to the foundations at the start of the
game.  Cards may be played from the foundations.
<h3>Strategy</h3>
The Wizards will not play to their foundation until all the suit cards
are on theirs.  This can make the end game a real challenge.
<h1>Hiranyaksha</h1>
<p>
FreeCell type.  One Dashavatara Ganjifa Deck.  No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="dieschlange.html">Die Schlange</a>,
using the ten suit Dashavatara Ganjifa deck and the number of cards you can move as a
sequence is not restricted.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
All cards are dealt to 9 piles at the start of the game, each Raja or King
starting a new pile.  Rows build down in rank regardless of suit.
Empty rows cannot be filled. The ten free cells will hold one card each.
<h1>Hopscotch</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<i>[To be written]</i>
<h1>Imperial Trumps</h1>
<p>
Tarock type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This game is similar to Klondike except the twenty-two trump
cards will play on any suit card of the next higher rank.
Cards will play on the foundation only if the trump card of
equal rank is played first.  That means the Ace of Spades
won't play on the Spade foundation until the Ace of Trumps
is played on the Trump foundation.  Only Kings or the highest
ranked Trump can be played on an empty row stack.  The highest
Trump is called either the Fool or the Skiz depending on the
type of deck.  It has either the number 0 or is not numbered.
Cards can be played from the foundations to the tableau.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Skillful tableau play with the trumps can make all the difference
in this game.  You can move a trump from a red card to a
black card of the same rank.  This will open the red card for
a black one of the next lower rank.

<p>
There is no building on the tableau piles - cards can only be
moved to the foundations, and spaces are not filled.
<p>

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="gypsy.html">Gypsy</a>,

<p>
The playing piles build down by alternate color, and an empty space
can only be filled by a King or a sequence starting with a King.

type game adapted to the Hanafuda cards.  The tableau consists of
six flower beds in two rows above and a Koi pond below with the
foundations at the top.  Cards build from first to fourth rank
on the tableau by suit and from fourth to first on the foundations.
Only first rank cards may be played on an empty row.  No more than
six cards may be played on a row.  Cards may be moved from the Koi
pond to either the rows or the foundations but may not be moved to
the pond.  Only one card may be moved at a time.

Move all cards to the Foundations.
<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="braid.html">Braid</a>
played with a single Dashavatara
<a href="../ganjifa.html">Ganjifa</a>
deck.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Game play is like Braid.  In this variation there are two Braid
stacks that each have their own set of Braid reserve stacks.  The
game lay out starts with the ten foundations in the outer most columns.
The next two columns inwards are the ten Braid reserves.  Then there
are two columns with five general reserves each.  The inner most two
columns are the two Braid stacks.  Each Braid starts with fifteen cards.
When one of the Braid reserves becomes open the card at the top of the
corresponding Braid will be moved there.  When all the cards from one
of the Braids are removed a card from the other Braid will be used.
<p>
Cuddapah is a city in India with a history in the production of Ganjifa cards.

<h1>Double Kali's Game</h1>

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="larasgame.html">Lara's Game</a>

<h3>Rules</h3>
Refer to the description of the deal in Lara's Game.  The differences
are that the cards are dealt to thirteen piles instead of fourteen

talon.  Only one 120 card Dashavatara deck is used.  Otherwise the
dealing rules are the same.
<p>
Play is the same as Lara's Game except that there are three redeals.  When
the talon is empty after each round the cards are gathered up from the
tableau and dealt to the rows without being shuffled using the same

The number of cards you can move as a sequence is restricted by
the number of free cells - the number of free cells required is the
same as if you would make an equivalent sequence of moves with single cards.
<h1>King Only Hex A Klon</h1>
Klondike type. One deck. One redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the Foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="klondike.html">Klondike</a>
with <a href="../hexadeck.html">Hex A Deck</a>
variations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Game play is like Klondike with the Wizards being wild.  They can be played
on the tableau as any rank or color.  Once a Wizard is played on a row however
that row may become unmovable.  If a Wizard is played in it's proper rank
position the row can still be moved.  A stack with two Wizards can be moved
only if they are both in their rank position and they are not adjacent to each
other.  The Wizards will not move off of the tableau until all the other cards
have been moved to the foundations.  Only Kings may be played on the canvas.
Cards may be played from the foundations.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Keep the Wizards off of piles that contain face down cards.  Once all the
cards on the tableau are face up try to get the Wizards out of the way.  Put
them all on one row stack until the suit cards have been moved to the foundations.
Since the Wizards will not play to the foundation until all the suit cards are on
the foundations, and since only Kings will play on an empty row, one Wizard is
dealt to the bottom of the second row from the left.  If you move that Wizard
and there is no other Wizard on the canvas, you will not be able to win the
game.

<h1>Klondike Plus 16</h1>
Klondike type. One deck. One redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the Foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="klondike.html">Klondike</a>
with <a href="../hexadeck.html">Hex A Deck</a>
variations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Game play is like Klondike with the Wizards being wild.  They can be played
on the tableau as any rank or color.  Once a Wizard is played on a row however
that row may become unmovable.  The Wizards have ranks like the suit cards
corresponding to Ace through four.  If a Wizard is played in it's proper rank
position the row can still be moved.  The rank can be determined comparing some
distinctive element of the images.  The first rank Wizard will be the most elaborate
in some way such as the fattest, the tallest hat etc.  A stack with two Wizards can
be moved only if they are both in their rank position and they are not adjacent
to each other.  Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time.  Only Kings may
be played on an empty row.  The Wizards may be played to the foundation at any
time in their proper rank order.  Cards may be played from the foundations.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
The Wizards may play to the foundation at any time, but they can be very helpful
in moving cards on the tableau.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="larasgame.html">Lara's Game</a>
with four decks, two redeals and a reserve stack.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Refer to the description of the deal in Lara's Game.  The differences
are the use of four decks instead of two two redeals and a reserve stack.
Otherwise the play and dealing rules are the same.
<p>
When the talon is empty after each round the cards are gathered up from
the tableau and dealt to the rows without being shuffled using the same
dealing rules as in the first round.  The foundations take two complete
rounds of a suit.  After the last card of the first round is played to
a foundation the first card of the second round will play.

<p>
The reserve stack will take any two cards from the rows.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Use the reserve stack to allow buried cards to play.  The best times
to use it are just before a redeal.  Once played to the reserve a
card may only be played from it to a foundation.
<h1>Lara's Game</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to 14 piles.  The piles are organized Ace through
five, six through ten, and then the three face cards, followed by the
Talon.  [Yes, cards are dealt to the talon!]  The rules for this deal
are as follows:
<p>
Cards are dealt to the first thirteen piles in order, until the 104
cards have been used up.  If the dealt card matches the place of the
pile it is placed on, one card is dealt to the talon.  If the card is
a face card, one card is dealt to the talon.  If the card is an Ace,
two cards are dealt to the talon.  Each time the deal reaches the King
pile, two cards are dealt to the talon and the deal starts over at the
Ace pile.
<p>
The four top foundations build up from Ace, while the left four
Foundations build down from King.  Only the top card of any stack is
playable, and the rest of the cards are hidden.
<p>
The piles at the bottom of the screen represent the player's hand.
Whenever a card is dealt from the talon, the player picks up the
corresponding pile, places the dealt card at the bottom of the hand
plays any cards that can be played, and replaces the hand to the pile
that was picked up.
<p>
There is no redeal.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
This game was taught to me by a wonderful woman.  Neither she nor I
knows where the game originated (it was taught to her by her older
sister).  This game is dedicated to her.  Note: it was taught to her
by her *other* older sister.  So it really shouldn't be called Lara's
game.  But that's what I'm used to calling it, so thus it remains.

<h1>Mahjongg</h1>
Mahjongg tile based solitaire games.

<h3>Object</h3>
Remove all tiles from the tableau.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Click on two matching tiles to remove them from the tableau.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Tiles may be removed from the tableau only in matching pairs and only
if both tiles are free.  A tile is free if there are no tiles on top
of it and no tiles either to the right or left of it.  A set of Mahjongg
tiles has three suits of nine tiles plus three Dragons and four Winds,
each of which is repeated four times.  And there four Seasons and four
Flowers.  This makes a total of 144 tiles in a complete set.  The three
suits are usually called Sticks, Coins and Strings although other names
are sometimes used.  A three of Sticks will only match another three of
Sticks.  The Dragons are known by their colors which are usually red,
green and white.  A green Dragon will only match another green Dragon.
The Winds are North, South, East and West.  North will only match North
etc.  Any Flower will match any other Flower and any Season will match
any other Season.

<h3>Strategy</h3>

<h1>Matriarchy</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. Varying number of redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the tableau piles.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The object of this game is to build sequences until all the cards are
used up. Cards are placed on Queens in descending order, following suit.
Kings are placed on the empty spaces above the queens, and then cards are
placed on the Kings in ascending order, starting with Ace, also following
suit. For each rank you complete, (that is, having one card of each value)
you get an extra chance at going through the talon. You are permitted to
move cards from one pile to another, as long as you still follow the rules.
The first time you go through the talon, the cards are given two at a time.
The second time, it is three cards, and so on up to twelve. If by that time
you have completed any ranks, your bonus runs start at eleven, then ten, and
so on. You win if you complete all the ranks.
<h1>Matrix</h1>
Matrix type. One deck. No redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
Restore game pieces to their proper order.

<h3>Rules</h3>
When the game opens the all game pieces except for the final piece are
dealt to the tableau in their proper order.  The pieces are then scrambled
to a random pattern.  With the larger grids it may take several seconds for
the scrambling to be completed.  Pieces may not be lifted from the canvas.
They may be moved by clicking on a piece which is in either the row or the
column which has the empty spot.  That piece and all intervening pieces will
move one space towards the empty spot.  The image game piece sets are best used
with the grid size for which they are designed.  The size is indicated in the
name of the set.  King of Hearts 4x4, Players Trumps 10x10, etc.  The default
set of numbered pieces works with any grid size.  When all the pieces have been
restored to their correct order the final piece will be dealt to the tableau and
the game has been won.  Every Matrix game can be solved.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Begin in the upper left hand corner and complete one row before starting the next.
Take a screen shot of the image sets before the game is scrambled.
<h1>MatsuKiri</h1>
<p>
Hanafuda type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The cards can only be moved to the foundation as entire suits, in order.
As in <a href="oonsoo.html">Oonsoo</a>,
the third and fourth rank cards are interchangable
for all suits except Rain.  Only first rank cards can play on the canvas.
First build the suits on the tableau.  Then pick up all four cards at
once and drop them on the foundation.  The foundation will only accept
a completed suit if the internal rank order is correct and it's played
in suit order.  Plum after Pine, Phoenix after Rain, etc.  Stacks in
the tableau can be moved if the cards in the stack are in order or
not.  There can be no more than twelve cards in a row.  The play in
this game is similar to Seahaven Towers, except there are no reserve
stacks.
<p>
This game can have "unbeatable" deals.  For instance, if the second
rank card of suit "a" is on the first rank card of suit "b", and the
second rank card of "b" is on the first rank card of "a", neither second
rank card can be moved.  You've lost.  It's also possible to play
yourself into a similar situation.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Hint: try to build more than one suit on the tableau at a time.

<h1>Montana</h1>
<p>
Montana type. 1 deck. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Group all the cards in sets of 12 cards in acscending sequence
by suit from Two to King.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This solitaire starts with the entire deck shuffled and dealt
out in four rows.  The Aces are then removed
making 4 initial free spaces.  You may move to a space only the card that
matches the left neighbor in suit, and is one greater in rank.  Kings are
high, so no cards may be placed to their right (they create dead spaces).
<p>
When no moves can be made, cards still out of sequence are reshuffled
and dealt face up after the ends of the partial sequences, leaving a card
space after each sequence, so that each row looks like a partial sequence
followed by a space, followed by enough cards to make a row of 13.

<h1>Narasimha</h1>
Dashavatara Ganjifa type. One deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Play is similar to
<a href="klondike.html">Klondike</a>.
The rows build down by rank in "alternate" colors.

<h3>Rules</h3>
The cards on the tableau build down in rank in alternate colors.  The
Dashavatara Ganjifa deck has ten suits and each suit has it's own color.
This makes it a bit problematic at times knowing which colors are alternate.
If a card of one suit doesn't play in a spot, try a different card of the
same rank.  The foundations build up in rank by suit starting with the Ace.
The cards are dealt from the talon one at a time.  There is no redeal.  Only
the Mirs (Kings) may be played on an empty row.  Cards may be played from the
foundations.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
The waste stack will be the biggest problem area.  Play from it first.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Play is similar to
<a href="klondike.html">Klondike</a>.
The rows build down by rank in "alternate" colors.

<h3>Rules</h3>
The cards on the tableau build down by rank in alternate colors.
The foundations build up in rank by suit starting with the Ace.
Only the Mirs (Kings) may be played on an empty row.  The Mughal
Ganjifa deck has eight suits and each suit has it's own color.
This makes it a bit of a challenge at times to know what colors
are the "alternates".  If a card doesn't play one place, try
a different card of the same rank.  Cards are dealt from the talon
three at a time.  There are no redeals.  Cards may be played from
the foundations.
<p>
This game is one of a series of games that have names ending in "pati"
which transliterates as "lord of".  Narpati means "Lord of Men".
The names are the names of the suits in a twelve suit Ganjifa deck.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Uncover the deepest row stacks first.  Move cards around on the
tableau to open spots for cards from the waste stack.

<h1>Neighbour</h1>
<p>
Pairing game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The object is to use up all the cards from the tableau, placing them
on the single foundation. You can only put a card on top of another card
when the numerical values of the two cards adds up to 13
and the two cards are touching horizontally, vertically or diagonally
(i.e. the cards have to be <i>Neighbours</i>).
<p>
You do not have to follow suit.
Jack is worth 11 and Queen is worth 12.
All Kings go off alone.
<p>
Empty spaces are filled automatically by shifting cards up and
dealing from the talon to the bottom piles.
<p>
You win when the tableau piles are all gone.

<h1>Nomad</h1>
<p>
Gypsy type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="gypsy.html">Gypsy</a>,
but with one extra free cell.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The eight playing piles in the tableau all start with four cards showing.
Piles build down by alternate color, and an empty space can be filled
with any card or sequence. The single free cell at the bottom may hold one
card at a time.
<p>
When no more moves are possible, click on the talon. One card will be
added to each of the playing piles.
<p>
You are also permitted to move cards back out of the foundation.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Making heavy use of the Undo key is explicitly encouraged here - you can win
many games with a little bit of thought. Keeping the free cell open for sorting
is usually a good idea.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
Nomad was created to be more strategic than Gypsy (hence all the open cards),
and be solvable more often than it under optimal play. From empiric data, I
find it's solvable in all but one in ten games, where I was solving only
slightly above a quarter of the Gypsy games. At the same time, the single free
cell gives it a very rich complexity.

<h1>Numerica</h1>
<p>
Numerica type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The foundations build up by rank - suits and colors are irrelevant.
<p>
One card is flipped over at a time and moved onto the stacks. There are no
restrictions on which card may go where on the stacks. Once on a stack,
a card can only be moved onto a foundation.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
To solve this, you will need to plan carefully when placing the cards onto
the stacks - one wrong move and you'll never be able to untangle the mess.
<p>
A good player can win about one out of three games without taking back moves.
<p>
The auto-solver is hopeless.  Don't believe the hints.

changes to "Setting".  When the last card is played, the label
reverts to the suit name.  Cards can be played on the foundations

are dealt from the talon four at a time, and there is only one
round.

<h1>Picture Gallery (Die Bildgallerie)</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Fill the entire Gallery with pictures.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The layout consists of three rows of playing piles, a row for newly-
dealt cards, and a castoff pile for Aces.
<p>
All Aces are cast off to the pile on the right.  Use the &lt;A&gt; key.
When you clear a space on the tableau,
you can only fill it with the right card:
<ul>
<li>In the first row, you build up sequences starting with a Four,
<li>in the second row with a Three, and in the
<li>third row with a Two.
</ul>
You build up sequences incrementing by three, up to
the face cards.  Thus, in the first row, each pile is 4-7-10-K, in the
second row 3-6-9-D, and in the third row, 2-5-8-B. Once a sequence has been
started, you have to follow suit.
<p>
If you clear a space at the bottom it will get automatically filled
with a card from the talon. But if the talon is gone and you clear a space
at the bottom, then you can fill it with any card.
When no further moves are possible, click on the talon for a fresh row
of cards at the bottom.
<p>
You win when the entire Gallery is filled with pictures, that is, face cards.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Because of the many piles involved the Picture Gallery requires some
concentration, but it is not too hard to win.
<h1>PileOn</h1>
<p>

same rank. This should leave two piles empty.
<p>
Cards can be moved on top of any other card or cards of the same rank.
Groups of cards can be moved if they are of the same rank.
<p>
A pile cannot have more than four cards, and an empty slot
can be filled with any card or group of cards with the same rank.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Keep one of the piles clear as much as possible. Don't allow a pile of
three cards to build up on top of a single card, especially if the
final card from the set is not a bottom card in another pile.

<h1>Sanibel</h1>
<p>
Yukon / Forty Thieves hybrid. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.
Cards in the Foundations are no longer available for play in
the Tableau. It is not compulsory to play any card to the Foundations.
<p>
The Tableau is built down by alternate color. Any group of cards may be
moved regardless of sequence, so long as the bottom card of the group is
placed on top of a card (in a different pile) that is the next higher card in
rank and of the opposite color.  An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled
with any group of cards, even a single card.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
<i>From John Stoneham, Sanibel's inventor:</i>
<p>
Sanibel and Captiva are islands off the coast of Ft. Meyers, Florida. One
summer while vacationing there, I played through all the games described in
<i>The Complete Book of Solitaire & Patience Games</i> by Albert H. Morehead
and Geoffrey Mott-Smith (published by Bantam, I believe). I really liked the
play of Yukon but thought the Tableau limited the strategic potential of the
game, so I added an extra deck and experimented with the Tableau layout,
aiming for a game that was almost entirely strategic in nature but not on the
10th order of mental magnitude. The result is Sanibel. The number of face-up
cards initially dealt to the Tableau determines how much "luck" will play a
factor in the game. If you only deal 3 or 4 face-up cards to each pile
retaining the balance in the Reserve, chances are you will loose some games.
Technically, there is nothing wrong with that, and sometimes I will play it
this way. On the other hand, dealing every card face up (except the last 4)
takes away nothing from the game and only serves to increase the strategy
involved. I prefer the 3-down-7-up layout, since the face down cards and the
small Reserve give you something immediate to work for, and it can generate a
little suspense when you know there is a card buried that you need and you're
trying to find a way to uncover it...

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
This is entirely a game of skill: if you loose, you just weren't paying
attention. Your first priority should be to expose all the face-down cards and
get the rest of the Reserve into play. Also, do not play a card onto a
Foundation simply because you can (Aces are OK; Twos are probably safe as
well): you may need it for building in the Tableau. You will find that you do
not need to calculate very long sequences to finish the game, but sometimes a
bit of calculation is necessary to expose the buried cards. Sometimes the piles
can grow longer than can be displayed in the window. This usually isn't a
problem, since you can break up the pile fairly often when other plays
become available. Here's something that's a lot of fun: If you have arranged
the cards in proper sequence, playing as few to the Foundations as possible
during the game, one press of the "Auto" button can play 90 or more cards to
the Foundations. It is possible to have every card in the Tableau at the end
of the game, even the Aces; the "Auto" button shoots them all up to the
Foundations in one long riffle!

<h1>Shisen-Sho</h1>
<p>
Shisen-Sho is a single-player-game similar to Mahjongg and uses the same
set of tiles as Mahjongg.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
The object of the game is to remove all tiles from the field.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The aim of the game is to remove all tiles from the board. Only two
matching tiles can be removed at a time. Two tiles can only be removed if they
can be connected with a maximum of three connected lines. Lines can be
horizontal or vertical, but not diagonal.
<p>
You don't have to draw the lines by yourself, the game does this for
you. Just mark two matching tiles on the board, if they can be connected with a
maximum of three lines, the lines will be drawn and the tiles are
removed.
<p>
Remember that lines only may cross the empty border. If you are stuck, you
can use the Hint feature to find two tiles which may be removed. Clicking a
tile with the right mouse button will show you all corresponding tiles, no

<h1>Sieben bis As</h1>
<p>
Montana type. 1 stripped deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This game is played with one stripped deck.
<p>
This 32-card solitaire starts with the entire deck shuffled and dealt
out in three rows and two extra reserves at the top.
All Sevens from the rows are then dealt to the foundations thereby
making initial free spaces.
<p>
You may move to a space only the card that
matches the neighbor in suit, and is one greater in rank than the left
neighbour or one less in rank than the right neighbour. Aces are
high, so no cards may be placed to their right (they create dead spaces).
<p>
The foundations build up from Seven to King and then Ace.
You may only move a card from the rows (and not from the reserves) to
the foundations if it has an empty left neightbour - this implies
that you cannot drop a card from the leftmost column without
moving it somewhere else first.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Don't drop cards to early - you should turn off <i>Autodrop</i> for this game.
