<h1>General Ganjifa Card Rules</h1>
Ganjifa are playing cards from India and other nations in the region.
Usually round, some rectangular decks have been produced.  The most significant
difference between Ganjifa and other types of cards is that Ganjifa cards have
traditionally been individually hand painted.  There are any where from eight
to twelve or more suits per deck, each suit having usually twelve ranks.  The
two most common Ganjifa decks are the Mughal which has eight suits and the
Dashavatara which has ten.  The suits have pip cards numbered from Ace through
ten and two court cards, the Wazir and the Mir.  Ganjifa solitaire games play
the same as games that use the standard deck but the larger number of different
cards in a deck (96 or 120) adds an element of complexity.  The fact that each
suit has it's own color makes things quite interesting in games that use
"Alternate Color" row stacks.
