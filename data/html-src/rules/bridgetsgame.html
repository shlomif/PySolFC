Hex A Deck game type. 2 decks. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="larasgame.html">Lara's Game</a>
with sixteen rows, one redeal and
<a href="../hexadeck.html">Hex A Deck</a>
variations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Refer to the description of the deal in Lara's Game.  The differences
are that the cards are dealt to seventeen piles instead of fourteen
and if a dealt card is of rank eleven or over one card is dealt to
the talon.  Otherwise the dealing rules are the same.
<p>
Play is the same as Lara's Game with two exceptions.  The first exception
is that there is one redeal.  When the talon is empty after the first
round the cards are gathered up from the tableau and dealt to the rows
without being shuffled using the same dealing rules as in the first round.
<p>
The other exception is the extra reserve stack just to the right of the
rows and the top foundations.  This reserve stack has the potential to
save a game that would otherwise be lost.  The way it works is this.
When empty it will accept any Wizard card, but only from a foundation.
Once a Wizard has been played on it, it will accept one card only from
any row stack.  Once played on the stack, cards can only be remove from
it to a foundation.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Don't play on the extra reserve stack unless you are sure the
top card will play to a foundation soon.

<h3>Notes</h3>
This game is dedicated to the memory of Bridget Bishop, hanged as a
witch on June 10, 1692 in Salem Massachusetts, U. S. A. and to the
nineteen other victims of that notorious witch hunt.
