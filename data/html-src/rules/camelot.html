<h1>Camelot</h1>

<h3>Object</h3>

<p>
Remove all cards but picture cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings).  You have
won if your Tableau looks like this -- <br>

<p>
-- and your Stock and Waste are empty. The suits do not matter.

<h3>Rules</h3>

<p>
There are two phases to this game.  Alternate between the two phases
until game is lost or won.  Start with Phase One until Tableau is
completely filled.  At that point, move to Phase Two.  Please note that
you cannot begin Phase Two unless Tableau is completely filled.  At any
point, you can return to Phase One, but remember that you cannot go back
to Phase Two unless the tableau is once again filled.  An exception to
this rule is if the stock and waste are empty.  

<p>
Phase One -- Click on the Stock to move a card into the empty Waste pile.  If
card is a:
<ul type="disc">
<li>
King: Place in one of the empty four corner spaces.
</li>
<li>
Queen: Place in one of the empty middle two spaces of the top or bottom row.
</li>
<li>
Jack: Place in any of the empty middle two spaces of the leftmost or rightmost
column.
</li>
<li>
Any other card:  Place in any empty space.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Phase Two -- Remove 10's singly by clicking on them.  Remove pairs that
add up to 10 by dragging one card on top of its pair.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
It is always safest in the middle.  During Phase One of play, deal in
the middle before going to the edges.  If you see a possible pair, place
that card on the edge so as to free more edge spaces during Phase Two of
play.
