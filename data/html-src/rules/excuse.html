<h1>Excuse</h1>
<p>
Tarock type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Rows build down in rank regardless of suit.  Only one card can
be moved at a time.  Foundations build up in rank by suit.  An
empty row stack cannot be filled.  For this reason the Kings and
the highest Trump are dealt to the bottoms of the rows.  Cards
can be played from the foundations.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Uncover low rank cards before building on higher rank cards on
top of them.  Use cards already on the foundations to assist in
moving rows.
