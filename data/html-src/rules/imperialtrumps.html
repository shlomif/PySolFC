<h1>Imperial Trumps</h1>
<p>
Tarock type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This game is similar to Klondike except the twenty-two trump
cards will play on any suit card of the next higher rank.
Cards will play on the foundation only if the trump card of
equal rank is played first.  That means the Ace of Spades
won't play on the Spade foundation until the Ace of Trumps
is played on the Trump foundation.  Only Kings or the highest
ranked Trump can be played on an empty row stack.  The highest
Trump is called either the Fool or the Skiz depending on the
type of deck.  It has either the number 0 or is not numbered.
Cards can be played from the foundations to the tableau.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Skillful tableau play with the trumps can make all the difference
in this game.  You can move a trump from a red card to a
black card of the same rank.  This will open the red card for
a black one of the next lower rank.
