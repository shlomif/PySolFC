<h1>Amazons</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Amazons is a solitaire card game which is played with a deck of playing cards.
What is interesting about this game is that it is played with a stripped deck,
i.e. one that has its deuces, treys, fours, fives, and sixes removed. This
game is so named because if the game is won, all queens are shown on full
view, so all kings are removed as well.
<p>
First, four cards are dealt. They would be the reserve. Above it is a space
for the foundations. Once an ace is available, it is placed on the foundations
and each ace should be placed in order on which they become available.
<p>
The first four cards dealt are the bases of the reserve piles, the top card of
each being available only to the foundation immediately above it. The
exception to this rule is a queen can be moved to its foundation from any
pile. The order of placing is <b>A-7-8-9-10-J-Q</b>.
<p>
When play goes on a standstill, four more cards are then dealt, one on each
reserve pile, and stop to see if any of the cards dealt can be placed on the
foundations. Spaces are not filled until the next deal. This process is
repeated until the stock runs out. When it does, a new stock is formed by
placing each pile over its right-hand neighbor, turn them face down and deal;
this should be done without reshuffling. The process of dealing the cards,
building to the foundations, and redealing, is repeated without limits until
the game is won or lost.
<p>
The game is won when all cards are built onto the foundations, with the queens
at the top.
