<h1>Four Seasons</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Four Seasons is a solitaire card game which is played with a deck of playing
cards. It is given the more appropriate alternate names of <b>Corner Card</b>
and <b>Vanishing Cross</b> because of where the foundations are placed and the
arrangement of the tableau respectively.
<p>
First, five cards are dealt in form of a cross: three cards are placed in a
row, then two cards are each placed above and below the middle of the three
cards. A sixth card is dealt in the upper left corner of the cross. This card
will be the base for the first of four foundations. The three cards of the
same rank are placed in the other three corners of the cross to become the
foundations themselves.
<p>
The foundations are built up in suit and building is round-the-corner, i.e.
aces are placed above kings, except when aces are the foundation bases.
<p>
Cards in the cross are built down regardless of suit and any space in the
cross is filled with any available card, whether it is the top card of a pile
within the cross, the top card of the wastepile, or a card from the stock.
Like the foundations, building in the cross is round-the-corner, i.e. kings
are placed over aces, unless aces are the foundations. Only one card can be
moved at a time.
<p>
Whenever the game goes on a standstill, the stock is dealt one card at a time
into the wastepile, the top card of which is available for play on the cross
or on the foundations. There is no redeal.
<p>
The game ends when goes on another standstill after the stock has run out. The
game is won when all cards end up in the foundations.

<h3>Variations</h3>
<p>
Below are the variations of Four Seasons:
<ul>
<li>In <b>Czarina</b>, any space in the cross is immediately filled only from
the stock.
<li>In <b>Corners</b>, the cross is in fact a reserve, not a tableau, and each
space is a cell, which should have room for only one card. Empty cells in this
game are filled immediately from the stock.
<li><b>Simplicity</b> is played like Four Seasons. The only exception is that
the tableau (instead of a cross) contains twelve cards dealt into two rows of
six. The thirteenth card deal becomes the base of the first formation. Also,
building in the tableau is down by alternating colors.
</ul>
