<h1>Parallels</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Parallels is a solitaire card game which is played with two decks of playing
cards. It is so called because the cards are lined up in rows parallel to each
other, so to speak.
<p>
First, one king and one ace of each suit is removed and the aces and kings are
each lined into columns to form the foundations. The aces are built up while
the kings are built down all by suit.
<p>
Between the two foundation columns, the player deals a row of ten cards,
forming the tableau. All of these cards are available for play on the
foundations and the spaces they leave behind are immediately filled from the
stock.
<p>
When play comes to a stand still, a second row of ten cards is dealt below the
first row. All cards are still available for play and the spaces left behind
are immediately filled from the stock.
<p>
When play comes to a stand still a second time, a third row of ten cards is
dealt. At this point onwards, the following rules apply:
<ul>
<li>A card is available to be built to the foundations if at least one of its
narrower edges is free. Therefore, the cards at the top and bottom rows are
available for play and card in the middle rows becomes available after a card
immediately above or below it is played.
<li>There is no compulsion in filling spaces in the tableau. As long as there
are moves available for player to make, spaces can be filled later.
<li>All spaces in the tableau must be filled when play goes on a standstill.
The order is from left to right, top to bottom. There is no building at this
point.
<li>Only when the existing spaces in the tableau are filled is the time
another row of ten card is dealt at the bottom of the existing rows.
<li>Peeking on the next card in the stock is absolutely not allowed; doing so
will force that card dealt to the tableau.
</ul>
<p>
Also, reversals are allowed in the game, i.e. when the two foundations of the
same suit meet at one point, the player can move the cards from one foundation
to the other except the base cards (ace and king) of the foundations.
<p>
The game ends when play stops after the stock has run out. The game is won
when all cards are built into the foundations.
