<h1>Sultan</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Sultan (or Sultan of Turkey) is a solitaire card game, meaning it is played
only by one person. However this game uses two packs of playing cards.
<p>
These cards make up the foundations and will be built up by suit in order. On
the single Ace of hearts foundation, the next cards will be 2 of hearts, 3 of
hearts, etc,. On the Kings, the order is Ace, 2, 3, etc, of the appropriate
suits. Throughout the game, the only card which you cannot place other cards
on is the King of hearts (the Sultan) in the center location.
<p>
Six cards (or eight in some versions) from the deck are placed around the main
layout to make up the reserve.
<p>
The player then makes moves, which may be:
<ul>
<li>Taking the top card from the face-down deck and placing it in the face-up
waste pile.
<li>Taking the top card from the waste and adding it to one of the foundation
cards.
<li>Moving a card from the reserve into the main design (following on the
suit) and then replacing it with the next card from the deck.
</ul>
<p>
The goal is to end the game with the Sultan (King of Hearts) surrounded by his
"Queens". When there are no more cards in the deck, the player may re-deal
(shuffle the waste and place face-down), but only twice per game. This means
the player may only run through the deck three times total, and then the game
ends.
