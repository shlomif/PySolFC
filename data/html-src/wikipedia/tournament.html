<h1>Tournament</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Tournament is a solitaire card game which uses two decks of playing cards
shuffled together. Despite the name, the game play doesn't seem to be related
to the word <i>tournament</i>.
<p>
First, the cards are shuffled and dealt as two columns of four cards laid out.
The player must make sure that these eight cards include either a king, an
ace, or both. If neither a king or an ace is found among these eight cards,
all cards are collected and shuffled and two new columns of four cards are
dealt. As long there is no king or ace among the eight cards, the shuffling
and dealing continues. When at least a king or an ace are present, six columns
of four cards are then dealt. At least a king or an ace must be present among
the first eight cards for the game to work. The first eight cards compose the
reserve (or "the kibitzers") and the six columns of four cards form the
tableau (or "the dormitzers").
<p>
The object of the game is to free one king and one ace of each suit and built
them by suit. The kings should be built down while the aces should be built
up.
<p>
The top cards of each column on the tableau and all eight cards on the reserve
are available.
<p>
The cards on the reserve are available to be built on the foundations, and any
space it leaves behind are filled from any from the tableau. But filling
spaces doesn't have to be done immediately; it is the player's discretion on
whether to fill a gap or leave it open.
<p>
The cards on the tableau are available only to be built on the foundation or
placed on a space in the reserve; they are not built on each other. In case
there is a gap resulting on all cards on the column leaving it, it is
immediately filled by a new set of four cards.
<p>
Furthermore, the top cards of foundations are available to be built on each
other, handy when the two foundations of the same suit meet.
<p>
When the player has made all the moves one could make, four cards from the
stock are deal onto each column. Then game play continues. Dealing of new
cards and making of new moves continue until all cards have been played.
<p>
After the game play goes on a standstill, the player then collects all the
cards on the tableau by first gathering the rightmost column and placing it on
the pile to its left, and then placing this new pile to the pile on its left
and so on. Then, without shuffling, six new columns of four cards each are
dealt. And game play continues as before. This can be done twice in the game.
<p>
The game is won when all cards are dealt onto the foundations.
