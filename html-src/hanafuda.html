<h1>General Flower Card Rules</h1>

<p>
There are some characteristics common to all the games played with Hanafuda
cards. They are all played with one or more of the Asian flower card decks.
This deck is common in a number of Pacific regions including Hawaii. There are
twelve suits of four cards each. The suits are associated with the twelve
months of the year. For a good explanation of what the suits are,
try <a href="http://hanafubuki.org/">Graham Leonard's Hanafuda and Kabufuda
site</a>.

<p>
Most of the flower card solitaire games are played like western deck games
with minor changes. See the <a href="general_rules.html">General Rules</a> for
basic instructions on how to play solitaire. The object in most cases is to
move all the cards from the tableau to the foundations. Probably the most
difficult part of learning to play with hanafuda cards is learning which cards
belong in which suits and what their ranking is. The ranking of the suits is
sometimes as important as the ranking of the cards in the suit. Try keeping
this hanafuda help image displayed where you can refer to it as you play.
