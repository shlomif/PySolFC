<h1>How to use PySol</h1>

<h2>Mouse Usage</h2>
<p>
Left mouse button:
<ul type="disc">
<li> Drag cards around
<li> Click on the Talon to deal new cards
<li> Click outside the stacks to undo (if use mouse for undo/redo is enabled)
</ul>
<p>
Right mouse button (or double-click the left button):
<ul type="disc">
<li> Drop cards to the Foundations
<li> Quick play (if enabled)
<li> Right-click outside the stacks to redo (if use mouse for undo/redo is enabled)
</ul>
<p>
Middle mouse button (or Ctrl-click the right button):
<ul type="disc">
<li> View partially overlapped cards
<li> If enabled, this can also be used to peek at face-down cards
</ul>
<p>
Ctrl-click the left mouse button:
<ul type="disc">
<li> Highlight all matching cards on the table
</ul>
<p>
Shift-click the left mouse button:
<ul type="disc">
<li> Highlight all cards with the same rank.
</ul>


<h2>Two-handed play</h2>
<p>
Put three fingers of one hand on '<i>A</i>' (auto drop),
'<i>S</i>' (undo) and '<i>D</i>' (deal).
You can also reach '<i>R</i>' (redo) from there.
<p>
Left-handed people may prefer using '<i>L</i>' (auto drop),
'<i>K</i>' (undo) and '<i>J</i>' (deal).

<h2>Keyboard play</h2>
<p>
PySol games can also be played exclusively using the keyboard:
<ul>
<li>Use the arrow keys to navigate around the different stacks.
<li>Use the tab key to navigate quickly between talon, waste,
tableau, foundation, and reserve.
<li>Use enter to select/move a card, or shift+enter for a quick
play move.
<li>In some games, you can use shift plus the up and down arrow
to navigate between layers in the game layout.
</ul>

<h2>Automatic play</h2>
<p>
Note that automatic play can spoil the gameplay, so purists should
not enable any option but maybe <i>Auto face-up</i>. Also, some games
disable certain features as they would be trivial otherwise.
<ul type="disc">
<li> <i>Auto face-up</i> - Automatically face-up all cards.
<li> <i>Auto drop</i> - Automatically drop cards to the Foundations.
<li> <i>Auto deal</i> - Automatically deal cards to the Waste stack if it is empty.
<li> <i>Quick play</i> - Use the right mouse button to move piles around quickly.
The logic involved is not too clever on purpose (i.e. it does not consult the hint system).
</ul>

<h2>Some notes about scoring</h2>
<p>
<ul type="disc">
<li> Scoring only begins after you make your first move.
     Also, if you undo all your moves back to the start
     the game won't score either.
<li> You will lose a game if you consume a hint (unless free hints are enabled)
     or start demo mode.
<li> You can restart any time to get another chance to win this game.
<li> If you don't want to score a lost game you can temporarily change
     the player options.
<li> Loaded games don't count.
<li> If you win a game without using <i>Undo</i>, <i>Quick play</i> and
     any other of the assist functions you will be given special awards.
<!--
<li> There are no score values in PySol - you win a game, or you lose it.
     And don't even think about asking me to implement this nonsense - get
     a nice pinball game if you're a highscore freak...
-->
<li> And finally always remember that this is a <b>Patience</b> game.
     Relax and enjoy.
</ul>
