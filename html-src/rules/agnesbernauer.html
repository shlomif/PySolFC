Raglan type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt face-up in seven piles of ascending length.  Seven cards are
set aside to be reserve piles and one card is dealt to a foundation.  This card
determines the base rank of the foundations.
<p>
Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternate color. Groups of cards in
sequence can be moved together.
<p>
Each deal flips one card from the Stock to the top of each of the reserve
piles.  There is no redeal.
<p>
Foundations are built up in suit in sequence, wrapping from King to Ace when
necessary. Cards in Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card
in the Tableau will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move
is possible.
