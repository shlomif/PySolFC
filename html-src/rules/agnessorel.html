<p>
Gypsy type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards in the Tableau are built down by same color. Groups of cards in sequence
and same color can be moved as a unit.
<p>
Each deal flips one card from the Stock to each pile of the Tableau. There are
no redeals.
<p>
Foundations are built up in suit in sequence, wrapping from King to Ace when
necessary. Cards in Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card
in the Tableau will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move
is possible.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Try to build down in suit whenever possible. Try to score as many points as
you can as this game is very hard to win.
