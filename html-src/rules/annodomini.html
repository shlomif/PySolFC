<h1>Anno Domini</h1>
<p>
Numerica type. 1 deck. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The base ranks for the foundation are based on the current year.
Each base rank is one rank higher than that digit in the year, with
tens representing zeroes.  This way, when the game is won, the cards
on the top of the foundations will show the current year.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit, wrapping from king to ace
as necessary.  The suits can be in any order.  Four cards are dealt to
four tableau piles, which are built down by alternating colors, once
again wrapping from ace to king as needed.  Any card or sequence of
cards can be moved between tableau piles and any card or sequence can
fill an empty pile.
<p>
Cards can be dealt from the talon one at a time and moved to the tableau
or foundations.  Two redeals are allowed, so you can go through the
talon three times.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
If a game of Anno Domini is saved and loaded, it will continue to use the
year that the game was started in.
