<h1>Antares</h1>
<p>
FreeCell type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
There are eight tableau piles, divided into two sets.  The first set of tableau
piles contains four piles, each with seven cards dealt to it, and are built
down by alternate color, with only one card being moved at a time.  The second
set consists of four piles, with six cards dealt to each, and are built down by
same suit, and cards can be moved regardless of sequence.  Empty piles on the
left stacks can be filled with any card, whereas piles on the right can only be
filled with kings.
<p>
A sequence can be moved from one set to the other, regardless of whether it matches
the rules of the piles it moved to, but in this case, the sequence cannot be moved
further.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit, from ace to king.  The game is won if
all cards are moved to the foundations.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
Demons and Thieves is a combination of FreeCell-type and Scorpion-type
games.  It was invented by Thomas Warfield.
