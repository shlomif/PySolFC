<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Archway is a variant of <a href="ladyofthemanor.html">Lady of the Manor</a>,
invented by David Parlett.  It is played similarly, except all cards in the
tableau are visible, and the foundations are built differently.  The first
four foundations have an ace of each suit dealt to them, and are built up
by suit, while the other four foundations have a king dealt to them and
are built down by suit.
<p>
As not all aces are dealt to the foundations, a thirteenth reserve pile
on the far left is used for extra aces.
