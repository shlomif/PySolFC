Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Nineteen cards are dealt to each of four reserve piles, all
face-down.  The next eight cards are dealt in a reserve row below -
two below each of the four reserve piles.  The remaining twenty
cards are dealt to ten tableau piles of two cards each.
<p>
The tableau piles are built down by alternate color, and any card or
valid sequence of cards can be moved between tableau piles.  Cards
from the reserve row can be moved to an appropriate tableau or
foundation pile, but building on this reserve row is not allowed.
Empty piles in this row are immediately filled from the adjacent
reserve pile.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit from ace to king.  The
game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
