<h1>Bastille Day</h1>
<p>
Terrace type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
First, all of the kings are set aside, with four additional cards.
The kings are placed on top of these cards, face-down, forming a
stack called the Bastille.
<p>
Of the remaining cards, they are dealt to eight piles of four cards
each, with only the top cards face-up, and nine cards are dealt to a
reserve.  Tableau piles are built down by alternate color, and any
card or valid sequence of cards can be moved between tableau piles, and
single cards from the top of the reserve can be moved to the tableau or
foundations.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal cards from the talon one at
a time and move them to the tableau or foundations.  Once the reserve
is empty, cards from the Bastille can be moved to the bottom of the
reserve one at a time.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit from ace to king.  The game is
won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
