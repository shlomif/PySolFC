<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A circle of twelve cards are dealt out to the foundations.  The two
of clubs is dealt in the nine o'clock position, each pile clockwise
dealt with a rank one higher, in suit order clubs-hearts-spades-diamonds,
leading to the king of diamonds in the eight o'clock position.  The
remaining cards are dealt out to eight piles of five cards each.
<p>
Move cards to the foundations until the top of each foundation is the
clock number for that position. Jack equals 11, Queen equals 12, and
Aces must be placed on Kings.  The foundations are built up by same suit.
<p>
The playing piles build down by same suit. Only the top card is
available for play, and empty rows cannot be filled.  When there are no
moves left, you can deal cards from the talon to the tableau piles until
each pile has at least three cards.  If the piles already have at least
three cards each, the remaining talon cards can be dealt one at a time.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
