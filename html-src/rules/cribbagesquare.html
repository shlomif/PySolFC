<h1>Cribbage Square</h1>
<p>
Cribbage type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Arrange the 10 Poker hands for a total score of 61 points or more.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Place the 16 cards on the tableau to get a score of 61 points or more.
<p>
Once on a stack, a card cannot be moved.
<p>
If you are playing a variant with reserve or waste stacks, cards may
be moved onto the top of one or two five-card reserve/waste stacks.  The
top card of a reserve stack may be moved to the grid at any time, but if
a card is moved to a waste stack, it cannot be moved.
<p>
Once all of the cards have been moved into the grid, another card
from the deck is flipped up to be used as the starter.  The starter is
mostly treated as a fifth card for each hand.  The starter cannot be moved
to reserve or waste stacks.
<p>
Points are awarded for the 4 Cribbage hands from left to right and for
the 4 hands from top to bottom.
<h3>Cribbage Scoring</h3>
<p>
Cribbage hands are scored as follows - each hand is worth the total value
of all of the following:
<ul>
<li>15 - 2 points are added to each hand for every combination of cards that
adds up to 15.
<li>Pair - 2 points are added for each set of two cards of the same rank.
<li>Pair Royal - For sets of the same rank of more than two cards, they
are scored by the number of individual pairs they contain.
<li>Run - Each combination of three or more cards of consecutive ranks
scores 1 point per card.  Only the largest possible run is considered.
<li>Flush - Four cards of the same suit are worth 4 points.  The starter
is not consiered when scoring flushes, but if it does match the suit of a
flush, that is an extra point.
<li>His Nobs - A jack of the same suit as the starter adds 1 point to
the hand.
<li>His Heels - If the starter is a Jack, 2 points are added to the
entire game.
</ul>
