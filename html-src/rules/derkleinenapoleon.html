<h1>Der kleine Napoleon</h1>
<p>
Napoleon type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This game is somewhat harder and requires thoughtful strategy.
<p>
The layout consist of 4 foundations in the middle,
8 row stacks (4 on each of the left and right side),
2 reserve stacks (one on each of the left and right side),
and a free cell in the middle.
<p>
The row stacks and reserve stacks grow from the middle and are laid out
open, but only the outer card is in play.
<p>
The foundations build either up or down in suit, depending on the
first card you play there.
They wrap around from King to Ace and Ace to King.
<p>
The 8 row stacks build both up and down in suit, also wrapping around.
Only a single card can be moved, and free rows can be filled with
any single card.
<p>
There is no building on the 2 reserve stacks. Cards can only be moved
to other stacks from there.
<p>
Finally there is one extra free cell that can hold any single card.
But to move a card back from the free cell at least one of the
two "blocking" reserve stacks must have been cleared.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Try <a href="derfreienapoleon.html">Der freie Napoleon</a> if
you have troubles understanding the rules - it is the exactly
same game in a different layout.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Decide carefully if you build the foundations up or down.
<p>
Getting a free row stack should be one of your highest priorities.
