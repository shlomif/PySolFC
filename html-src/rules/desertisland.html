The aces are dealt to the foundations.  One card is dealt to
each of 24 tableau piles.  No building on the tableau is allowed,
though empty tableau piles can be filled with a single card from the
top of another pile.  The foundations are built up by same suit from
ace to ten.  Jacks, queens, and kings cannot be moved to the
foundations.

When there are no moves left, deal one card from the talon to each
of the tableau piles, arranged so only the top card is visible.  The
game is won if all the aces through tens are moved to the foundations.
