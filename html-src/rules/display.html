<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
At the start of the game, one card is dealt to the leftmost
of thirteen foundations.
<p>
Deal cards from the stock one at a time.  You go through the talon
twice.  During the first deal, each card must be played to one of
three special reserve piles.  The top card from any of these can be
moved to the foundations only.  When redealing, these reserve
piles are put together to form a new deck.  During the second deal,
these reserve piles are unused, and cards are simply dealt to the
waste pile.
<p>
Cards from the waste pile or reserves may be moved to foundations,
which are built down by rank, wrapping down from ace to king as
necessary.  A card cannot be placed in a foundation unless the foundation
to the left of it has cards in it.  Each foundation starts with a card
one rank lower than the foundation to the left of it, and can hold eight
cards max.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
