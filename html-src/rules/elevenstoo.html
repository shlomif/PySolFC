<h1>Elevens Too</h1>
<p>
Pairing type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the single foundation.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="elevens.html">Elevens</a>,
but when a king, queen, or jack is in the reserves,
those tableau piles are not filled until they are
discarded to the foundation.  In other words, the
King, Queen, and Jack must all be discarded at the
same time.
