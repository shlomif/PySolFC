<h1>Families</h1>
<p>
Memory game type. 32 cards. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Remove all groups of jack-queen-king of the same suit.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Families is played with eight sets of Jack, Queen, and King - two of
each suit, along with six black jokers and two red jokers.
<p>
Flip three cards.  If you flip a sequence of Jack, Queen, and King of
the same suit, the cards are removed.  If not, they are flipped face-down.
<p>
If a red joker is flipped, all of the remaining unmatched cards that were
not flipped are reshuffled and redealt (after you've flipped all three
cards).
<p>
If a pair of black jokers is flipped, the game is lost.  If all eight
sequences are removed before this happens, the game is won.
