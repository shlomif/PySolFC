<h1>Flow</h1>
<p>
One-deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the tableau, in four columns with complete sequences from
king to ace.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="wavemotion.html">Wave Motion</a>,
but cards and card sequences can be moved between
reserve piles.  Like the tableau piles, the reserve
stacks are built down by same suit, but only a single
card can be used to fill an empty reserve stack.
