<h1>Flower Clock</h1>
<p>
Hanafuda type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This one is for people who want a mindless distraction.  It's a good
way to learn the suits and ranks of the flower cards.  The foundations
build from fourth rank to first, by suits.  Any fourth rank card can be
played on any open foundation stack, but a game doesn't count as a win
unless the suits are in their proper order.  That means Pine is at 1
o'clock, Plum at 2 o'clock etc.  Once a card is played on a foundation stack
it can't be taken off except by undoing the move.  There can be no
more than eight cards in a row.

<p>
The cards in the tableau build from first rank to fourth, without regard
to suit.  The third and fourth rank cards are interchangable.  Any card
can be played on the canvas.
