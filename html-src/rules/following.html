<h1>Following</h1>
<p>
Forty Thieves type. 1 deck. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Six cards are dealt out to form the initial tableau.  Cards may be
moved to foundations, which are built up in rank, in a specific
sequence of suits, in the following order:
<ul>
<li>Hearts</li>
<li>Clubs</li>
<li>Diamonds</li>
<li>Spades</li>
</ul>
<p>
Tableau piles are built down by rank, following the same sequence
of suits as the foundations.  Any sequence of cards in the tableau
can be moved.  When no cards are left to play, cards may be dealt
one at a time from the stock.  One redeal is allowed, so you can go
through the stock twice.
