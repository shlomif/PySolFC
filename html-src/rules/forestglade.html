Cards are dealt into 16 piles of three cards.  Tableau piles

Empty piles can be filled by kings.

is built up from two with even numbered ranks (2-4-6-8-10-Q).

The cards can be reshuffled and redealed twice.  If there are
any empty spaces, three cards from the stock can be dealt to
fill that pile (this does not count as a redeal).
