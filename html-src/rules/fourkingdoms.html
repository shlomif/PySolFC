<h1>Four Kingdoms</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the different foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to seven piles of four cards each, with only the top
card of each pile face-up.  These are the free lands, and may be built
up by same suit.  Any valid sequence can be moved, and any card or
sequence can be played in an empty space.
<p>
Above the free lands are multiple columns of foundations/reserves,
which accept different cards according depending on which other
piles have been played to.  There is one row of these piles for each
suit.  From left to right, these are:
<ul>
<li>Dungeon - Aces represent dragons - no card can be played on an ace,
as such, an ace will essentially block its pile until it can be "banished"
to a dungeon.  The ace can only be moved to the dungeon if the king, queen,
jack, and ten of the same suit are played in the tower/castle for that suit,
appropriately.
<li>Tower - Tens represent wizards - the ten of each suit can be played
to the appropriate tower at any time.
<li>Guest Chamber - The guest chamber acts as a free cell for each suit.  Any
single card other than the ace of that suit can be temporarily played to the
guest chamber, until it can be moved to a space in the free lands or another
foundation later.  It can only be used if the king and queen of the same suit
are played to the castle.
<li>Castle - The castle is a series of three foundations for each suit,
and the king, queen, and jack can be played to them, in that order.
<li>Subjects - The remaining cards are played to the subjects foundation,
built down by same suit from nine through two.  Cards can only be moved to
the subjects foundation once the king, queen, and jack of the same suit
have all been played to the castle.
</ul>
<p>
Cards can be dealt from the talon one at a time, and moved to an
appropriate pile in the free lands, or any of the aforementioned
foundation/reserve piles.  No redeal is allowed.
<p>
The game is won if all cards can be moved to their appropriate foundations,
thus uniting the four kingdoms.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Four Kingdoms was invented by David Bernazzani.  It was designed to try and
reclaim some of the original historical feel for the cards.
