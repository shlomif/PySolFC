One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Five cards are dealt to the tableau, in a cross shape.  The
four foundations are in the corners of the tableau.  A single
card is dealt to one of the foundations - this is the base rank
for the foundations for this game.
<p>
Tableau piles are built down by rank, regardless of suit.  The
foundations are built up by suit.  Both wrap from ace to king as
necessary.  Single cards can be moved between tableau piles and
any card can fill an empty pile.
<p>
Cards can be dealt from the talon one at a time.  The last dealt
card can be moved to an appropriate tableau pile or foundation.
No redeal is allowed.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
