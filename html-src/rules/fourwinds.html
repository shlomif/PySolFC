One-Deck game type. 1 deck. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>

Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The aces are dealt to four foundation piles, and four reserves are
placed next to each foundation.  A card is dealt to all sixteen
reserves.  The foundations are built up by same suit.  Each reserve
pile can only be filled with a card of the same suit as its associated
foundation.  Only one card is allowed in each reserve.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time, and can be moved to an
appropriate foundation or reserve.  One redeal is allowed, so you can
go through the talon twice.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
