Numerica game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="grandfather.html">Grandfather</a>,
but there are twenty-two tableau piled, all cards
dealt from the stock must be played to tableau
or foundation piles immediately, and there are
four reserve piles.
<p>
Additionally, at the start of the game, one card
is dealt to a foundation.  One set of foundations is
built down by suit from that rank while the other is
built up by suit from the rank one higher.  Foundation
piles wrap from ace to king as necessary.
