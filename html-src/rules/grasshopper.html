<h1>Grasshopper</h1>
<p>
Tarock type. 1 deck. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The tableau consists of one reserve stack, one Trumps only row stack,
and five row stacks.  Fourteen cards are dealt to the reserve
stack and one card each to the row stacks.  When a row stack is emptied
it must be filled from the reserve stack first.  When the reserve stack
is empty any card can be played on an empty row stack.  The Trumps only
stack is left empty and can be played on at will.  The row stacks
build down in rank by alternate colors.  The Trumps can be played as
either color.  The Trumps only row stack also builds down in rank.  It
will accept a stack of cards that contains suit cards as long as the
bottom card is a Trump.  The foundations build up in rank by suit.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
The first priority is to empty the reserve stack.  Once that's done
try to keep one or more row stacks open.  Play
high rank cards on the rows and build down on them.  The same goes for
the Trumps only row.
