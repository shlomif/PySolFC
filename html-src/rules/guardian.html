<h1>Guardian</h1>
<p>
Klondike type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The tableau piles are built in a pyramid-esque layout, with five cards
in the top layer, four cards in the middle, and three in the bottom.
Each card forms a tableau pile which can be built down by alternate
color.  The three bottom layer cards can be filled with any card when
empty, but the remaining layers cannot be filled.  Cards in the lower
layers can only be flipped if the two cards overlapping them are
removed.
<p>
Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the stock three at a time, and can be moved to
foundations or exposed tableau piles.  You can go through the deck
as many times as needed.
<p>
The game is won when all cards are moved to the foundations.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
The name of the game comes from the way a single card (especially an
immovable king) can "guard" multiple cards beneath them.
