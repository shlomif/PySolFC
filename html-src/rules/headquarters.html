FreeCell type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to eight tableau piles of thirteen
cards each.  The tableau piles are built down by alternate
color, and any card or valid sequence of cards can be moved
between tableau piles.  Empty tableau piles cannot be filled.
<p>
A card or valid sequence of cards can be moved to one of six
free cells, but while multiple cards can be moved to free cells,
they must be moved as a unit, and cards can only be moved to
empty free cells - additional cards cannot be moved to occupied
cells.  However, any part of the sequence can be moved back to
the tableau, or another free cell.
<p>
The foundations are built up by suit from ace to king.  The game
is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
