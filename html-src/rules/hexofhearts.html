In all four foundations, the wizards represent a rank of 17, and a wizard is
the last card played to close each foundation.  Which wizard is played to which
foundation does not matter.

Once on a stack, a card can only be moved onto a foundation.  The game is won
when all cards are moved to the foundations.
