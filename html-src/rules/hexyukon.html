<h1>Hex Yukon</h1>
<p>
Hex A Deck type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="yukon.html">Yukon</a>, except the wizards are wild, but
can only be moved as individual cards.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Game play is like Yukon with the Wizards being wild.  They can be played
on the tableau as any rank or color.  However, wizards can only be moved as
individual cards, meaning any cards behind a wizard are blocked until the Wizard
is moved.  Wizards can be moved to a separate foundation at any time, in order
by their rank.  Wizards' ranks can be identified by the size of their hats, with
the one with the tallest hat being the one, and the remaining wizards' ranks
have increasingly smaller hats.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Be careful where you play the wizards.  While you can use them to free up any
cards you like, if you play them on the wrong pile, you might end up blocking
a more important card later.
<p>
There are certain patterns in how you choose to move the wizards that will help
you use them most effectively.  You'll just have to figure them out...
