<h1>Intrigue</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations, except for the queens.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
At the start of the game, a single queen is dealt to the tableau.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the talon to a tableau pile one at a time.
While dealing to the tableau, any exposed cards can be moved
to the foundations.  One set of foundations is built up from
sixes to jacks, and the other set is built down from five to
ace, with the kings then played on the aces.  All foundations
are built by rank, regardless of suit.
<p>
If a queen would be dealt to the tableau, the current tableau
pile is completed, and the queen is used to start a new pile.
Cards are dealt to this pile before the next pile.
<p>
Once all of the cards have been dealt to the tableau, tableau
piles containing only the queens can be treated as empty piles,
and any single card can be moved to them.
<p>
The game is won if all cards other than the queens are moved to
the foundations.
