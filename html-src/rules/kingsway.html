<h1>King's Way</h1>
<p>
Golf type. 2 decks. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards except the kings to the waste stack.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Deal the eight kings to eight tableau piles.  Then, deal five cards on
top of each king - the bottom-most one face-down and the others face-up.
<p>
Deal cards from the talon one at a time.  You can move cards from the
tableau to build the waste stack up or down by alternate color.  Kings
cannot be moved to the waste stack.
<p>
There is an additional reserve pile.  Aces from the waste stack (not the
tableau) may be moved to this reserve.  This reserve controls a single
redeal - when the talon is empty, you can take one card from the bottom
of the tableau for each card in the reserve, and use these cards to
build a new talon.  You can only do this once.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the waste pile, except for the
immovable kings.
