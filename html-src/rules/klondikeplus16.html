<h3>Quick description</h3>

variations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Game play is like Klondike with the Wizards being wild.  They can be played
on the tableau as any rank or color.  Once a Wizard is played on a row however
that row may become unmovable.  The Wizards have ranks like the suit cards
corresponding to Ace through four.  If a Wizard is played in it's proper rank
position the row can still be moved.  The rank can be determined comparing some
distinctive element of the images.  The first rank Wizard will be the most elaborate
in some way such as the fattest, the tallest hat etc.  A stack with two Wizards can
be moved only if they are both in their rank position and they are not adjacent
to each other.  Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time.  Only Kings may
be played on an empty row.  The Wizards may be played to the foundation at any
time in their proper rank order.  Cards may be played from the foundations.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
The Wizards may play to the foundation at any time, but they can be very helpful
in moving cards on the tableau.
