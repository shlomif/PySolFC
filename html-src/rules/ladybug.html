At the start of the game, seven cards are dealt to seven tableau

cards is optional.

The tableau piles can contain a max of 4 cards each.  Each tableau
pile is to be built up to total 10.  Aces equal 1 and face cards
have a value of 0.  Tens are wild and can equal any value from 0 to
10.  Once played, a card in a tableau pile cannot be moved.  The
goal of the game is to build each pile with four cards with a total
value of 10.
