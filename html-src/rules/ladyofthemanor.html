<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
At the start of the game, the aces are dealt to eight foundations.
Four tableau piles of twelve cards are dealt, with only the top card
of each pile visible.  The remaining cards are dealt to twelve reserve
piles, forming an arch around the tableau, with each pile being dealt
the cards of a different rank - twos on the far left, leading up to
kings on the far right.
<p>
Cards from the reserves or tableau can be moved to foundation piles,
building the foundation piles up by rank, regardless of suit.  No
building on the tableau is allowed.  The game is won when all cards have
been moved to the foundations.
