<h1>Matrimony</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 16 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
One Jack and Queen of diamonds are dealt to the foundations.
An additional card is dealt to each of sixteen tableau piles.
There are two sets of foundations, one built down by rank from
Jack to Queen, and the other built up from Queen to Jack, all
turning the corner from King to Ace or Ace to King as necessary.
Each set contains one foundation of each suit.
<p>
Cards from the tableau can be moved to appropriate foundations,
but building on the tableau is not allowed.  When there are no
moves left, you can deal one card from the talon to each of the
tableau piles.
<p>
Once the talon is empty, you are allowed additional redeals, by
taking the pile in the bottom right, and dealing the cards from
it to other tableau piles, one each, starting with the pile
directly to the right of it (or the top left pile for the bottom
right pile).  After this, you can do the same for each tableau
pile, going right to left, bottom to top, until you've redealt
each pile once.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
