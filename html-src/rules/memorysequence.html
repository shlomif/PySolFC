<h1>Memory Sequence</h1>
<p>
Memory game type. 13 cards. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Flip all of the cards in sequence from ace to king, and get a score of 75 or
more.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
At game start, all the cards of a single suit (spades in PySol) are dealt
face-down.  Cards can be flipped over one at a time, each card flipped
over is worth 10 points, but if the next card is not one rank above the
previous card, all are flipped face-down.  If a card doesn't match, all of
the points from that sequence are lost, and a 2 point penalty is applied.
<p>
The game is over when all cards have been flipped over in one sequence, from
ace through king.  A winning score is 75 points or more.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
To get awarded for a perfect game you must reach the maximum score of
130 points. You can reach this by restarting the game.
