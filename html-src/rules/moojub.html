<h1>Moojub</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Four cards are dealt to reserves from the talon at the start of the
game.  Cards from the reserves may be moved to foundations.
<p>
The foundations in Moojub are unique in that there are four rows of
foundations, containing a number of different columns.  If a foundation
has been started (at least one card in it), it is built up by suit,
turning the corner from king to ace as necessary.  An empty foundation
can be started by playing a card to it, following these rules:
<ul>
<li>Foundations must be started in sequence, starting with the leftmost
column and moving right.  Within each column, the topmost row must be
started first, and moving down.</li>
<li>Each foundation must be started with a card with the same suit as
the card in the foundation directly to the left (except in the leftmost
column, of course).</li>
<li>In the first column, each row must be started with a card of a
different suit.</li>
<li>If the reserve contains multiple visible cards of the same suit,
only the one with the lowest rank can be used to start a foundation.</li>
<li>If a card can legally be played on an existing foundation, it
cannot be used to start a new one.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal one card from the talon
to each of the four reserve piles.  The game is won if all cards have
been moved to foundations (it doesn't matter which foundations are
empty, and how many cards are in each).
