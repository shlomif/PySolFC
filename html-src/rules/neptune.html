<h1>Neptune</h1>
<p>
Pairing game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Pair off cards until you empty the talon.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Eight cards are dealt to the tableau.  Pairs of cards of
consecutive rank can be removed and discarded to the single
foundation, and the spaces are filled from the talon.
<p>
The game is won if the talon is emptied.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Unlike most pairing type games, you won't need to move all cards
to the foundation, because it is mathematically impossible to do
so.  However, after winning the game, if you click "Back to Game",
it's often possible to pair off a few more cards, leaving as few
as four cards left in the end.
