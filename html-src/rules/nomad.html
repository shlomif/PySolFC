<h1>Nomad</h1>
<p>
Gypsy type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="gypsy.html">Gypsy</a>,
but with one extra free cell.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The eight playing piles in the tableau all start with four cards showing.
Piles build down by alternate color, and an empty space can be filled
with any card or sequence. The single free cell at the bottom may hold one
card at a time.
<p>
When no more moves are possible, click on the talon. One card will be
added to each of the playing piles.
<p>
You are also permitted to move cards back out of the foundation.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Making heavy use of the Undo key is explicitly encouraged here - you can win
many games with a little bit of thought. Keeping the free cell open for sorting
is usually a good idea.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
Nomad was created to be more strategic than Gypsy (hence all the open cards),
and be solvable more often than it under optimal play. From empiric data, I
find it's solvable in all but one in ten games, where I was solving only
slightly above a quarter of the Gypsy games. At the same time, the single free
cell gives it a very rich complexity.
