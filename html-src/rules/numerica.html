<h1>Numerica</h1>
<p>
Numerica type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The foundations build up by rank - suits and colors are irrelevant.
<p>
One card is flipped over at a time and moved onto the stacks. There are no
restrictions on which card may go where on the stacks. Once on a stack,
a card can only be moved onto a foundation.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
To solve this, you will need to plan carefully when placing the cards onto
the stacks - one wrong move and you'll never be able to untangle the mess.
<p>
A good player can win about one out of three games without taking back moves.
<p>
The auto-solver is hopeless.  Don't believe the hints.
