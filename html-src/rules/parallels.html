<h1>Parallels</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
One king and ace of each suit are dealt to the foundations.
Ten cards are dealt to a row in the tableau.  Cards from the
tableau can be moved to the foundations, with the foundations
with the aces built up by same suit to king, and the
foundations with the kings are built down by same suit to ace.
There is no building in the tableau.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal cards from the
talon to fill the empty spaces in the tableau.  If there are
no empty spaces, you can deal an additional row of ten cards
below the current one.  Once there are more than three rows,
only cards with no card directly above or below them can be
moved.
<p>
Building on the tableau is otherwise not allowed.  The game is
won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
