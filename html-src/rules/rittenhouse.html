<h1>Rittenhouse</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to nine tableau piles.  One set of foundations is located
above the leftmost four tableau piles, and these are built up by rank from
ace to king, regardless of suit.  A second set is located above the rightmost
four piles, built down by rank from king to ace, regardless of suit.  A card
can only be moved to a foundation from the pile directly under it, or from the
middle pile, and cards that can be moved to the foundations are moved there
immediately.
<p>
During the initial deal, after dealing each row, any cards that can be moved
to a foundation are moved there immediately.
<p>
Following the initial deal, the tableau piles are built up or down by rank,
regardless of suit.  Only single cards can be moved between tableau piles, and
any card can fill empty piles.  The game is won if all cards are moved to the
foundations.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
The invention of Rittenhouse is credited to Captain Geoffrey T. Spaulding,
the notable African explorer.  Captain Spaulding is actually a character
played by Groucho Marx in the 1930 film, Animal Crackers.  The name
Rittenhouse comes from Mrs. Rittenhouse, a millionaire he tries to impress
during the film.
