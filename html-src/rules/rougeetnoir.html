<h1>Rouge Et Noir</h1>
<p>
Gypsy type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to nine of ten tableau piles, with the first
containing eight cards, and each additional pile containing one
less than the previous pile, until the last pile contains only
one card.  Only the top cards are face-up  The tenth pile starts
empty.
<p>
Tableau piles are built down by alternate color, and any valid
sequence of cards can be moved between piles.  Only kings or
sequences of cards starting with them can be moved to empty piles.
<p>
The unique aspect of Rouge Et Noir is the fact that there are
two sets of foundations, built using different methods.  The first
set is built more traditionally, starting with an ace of each suit,
then building up by alternate color to king.  The second set is
built in a manner more akin to <a href="spider.html">Spider</a>,
in that a full sequence of cards from king to ace can be moved to
each of these.  Cards in the foundations cannot be moved back,
or to other foundations.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
