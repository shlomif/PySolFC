Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 8 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>

Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card of each rank from ace to eight is dealt to the eight
foundation piles.  Each pile is built up by the rank of that card,
subtracting thirteen when the total exceeds thirteen, so the
foundations are ultimately built as follows:
<pRE>
1:  A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 T J Q K
2:  2 4 6 8 T Q A 3 5 7 9 J K
3:  3 6 9 Q 2 5 8 J A 4 7 T K
4:  4 8 Q 3 7 J 2 6 T A 5 9 K
5:  5 T 2 7 Q 4 9 A 6 J 3 8 K
6:  6 Q 5 J 4 T 3 9 2 8 A 7 K
7:  7 A 8 2 9 3 T 4 J 5 Q 6 K
8:  8 3 J 6 A 9 4 Q 7 2 T 5 K
</pRE>
The remaining cards are dealt to eight piles of twelve cards each.
Cards from the tableau can be moved to appropriate foundations.  When
there are no moves left, you are allowed additional redeals by taking
each tableau piles, and dealing the cards from it to other tableau
piles, starting from it and going right.  You are allowed to redeal each
pile once, going from left to right.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
