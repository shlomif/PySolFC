<h1>Step-Up</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the upper step/foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
At the start of the game, single cards are dealt to 13 reserve piles,
and nine tableau piles directly below the reserve.  The tableau piles
are called the "lower step" while the reserves are called the "middle
step".  A single card is dealt to a foundation pile above - the foundations
are called the "upper step".  This first card determines the base rank of
the foundation.
<p>
Piles in the lower step are built down by alternating color, wrapping from
ace to king as needed.  Any card can be used to fill an empty pile in the
lower step, but only single cards may be moved.  No building is allowed in
the middle step.  Cards from the lower step can be moved to empty piles in the
middle step, but not the other way around.  Cards can only be moved to the
foundation from the middle step or the waste (they may be moved directly
from the lower step if there's an empty pile in the middle step).
<p>
Cards can be dealt from the talon to the waste one at a time, though if there
is an empty pile in the middle step, only three cards can be dealt from the
talon before it must be filled.  Cards from the waste can be dealt to any
of the three steps.  No redeal is allowed.  The game is won if all cards
are moved to the upper step/foundations.
