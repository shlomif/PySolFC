<p>
One card is flipped over at a time and moved onto the row stacks. There are no
restrictions on which card may go where on the stacks. Once on a stack,
a card can only be moved onto a foundation.

The foundations build up in suit from Ace to King. You can only move
cards to the foundations once all cards have been placed on the
row stacks and the talon is empty.
