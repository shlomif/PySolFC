<h1>Striptease</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all of the cards except the queens to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Striptease is a risque variation of <a href="takeaway.html">Take Away</a>.
<p>
Four tableau stacks of 13 cards each are dealt.  The queens are placed at
the bottom of these stacks, and a single face-down card is dealt on top of
the queens.  The remaining cards are dealt face-up.
<p>
Cards may be moved to one of the six foundations one at a time.  Any card
may be used to start one of the foundations, but after that, the
foundations are built in sequence up or down in rank.  Turning the
corner is allowed, so aces may be played on kings, and vice versa.
<p>
Queens are skipped when building sequences on the foundations, so jacks may
be played directly on kings and vice versa.
<p>
You may not move cards between tableau stacks.
<p>
The face-down cards remain face-down until all of the face-up cards, except
the queens, have been moved to the foundation.  Then, they are all revealed.
<p>
You win if you get all the cards to the foundations except for the queens.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
The name of the game comes from its objective, to "strip" the queens of the
covering cards.
