<h1>Terrace</h1>
<p>
Terrace type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
At the start of the game, eleven cards are dealt into a reserve
pile, and four cards are dealt into the first of nine tableau piles.
One of these four cards must be played to the foundation.  This card
serves as the starting rank for building the foundation for the remainder
of the game.
<p>
Once the first foundation card is chosen, deal five cards into the
remaining five tableau piles.  Cards may be moved between tableau
piles one at a time, building down by alternating colors.  Sequences
can turn the corner, so aces can be played on kings.  If a tableau pile
is empty, fill the pile using the card from the top of the waste pile,
or the stock if it's empty.  If both are empty, any other card from the
tableau may be moved there to fill the space.
<p>
Build up the foundations by alternating colors, starting with the
first chosen rank.  The top card of the reserve may be played to an
appropriate foundation pile, but not the tableau.
<p>
Cards may be dealt one at a time from the stock, and the card from the
waste may be played to an appropriate foundation or tableau pile.  No
redeal is allowed.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Consider what cards are in the reserve when choosing your starting
rank and choose carefully.  The right or wrong card chosen at the
very start can make or break the game.
