<h1>The Bogey</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the columns.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Deal five cards to your hand.  Cards in your hand may be either moved
to one of twelve columns, discarded, or held.  Any card can be played to
an empty column, but if a column is not empty, only a card of the same suit
but a lower rank can be played on the column.
<p>
When you are finished moving cards from your hand, draw one card from the
talon - this is the Bogey's card.  You must immediately play this card to
one of the columns.  If you cannot do so, the game is lost.  Once the Bogey's
card has been played, draw cards from the talon until you have a new five
card hand, and then you can play these cards as before.
<p>
When the talon is empty, the discarded cards are shuffled to form a new talon,
and play continues until you get stuck by one of the Bogey's cards, or you
win by moving all cards to the columns.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
The goal of The Bogey is to get all the cards in as few columns as possible.
Though the maximum you are allowed to win the game is 12, you can get a better
score by using even fewer columns:
<ul>
<li>Novice: 12 columns
<li>Normal: 11 columns
<li>Advanced: 10 columns
<li>Legendary: 9 columns
<li>Epic: 8 columns
</ul>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>
The Bogey was invented by Katharine Turner.
