<h1>The Jolly Roger</h1>
<p>
Spider type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Group all the cards in sets of cards in descending sequence
by suit or color, as described below, and move these sequences to
the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to thirteen piles of three cards each.  Cards from
twos through kings are built down by twos, though only sequences of
the same suit can be moved as a unit.  So sequences can be built down
as K-J-9-7-5-3 or Q-10-8-6-4-2.  A full same suit sequence following
either of these patterns can be moved to a foundation.
<p>
Aces are instead built by same rank, with only sequences of aces that
are the same color being able to be moved together.  Four aces of the
same color in a sequence can be moved as a unit to a foundation.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal one card from the talon to
the top of each tableau pile.  The game is won when all the cards have
been moved to the foundations in one of the aforementioned sequences.
