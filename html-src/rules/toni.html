The eight foundations are arranged in the shape of a T.

the middle bar.  Twelve cards are dealt to tableau piles,
six on each side of the T.

Building on the tableau is not allowed, cards can only be
moved to the foundations.  If there are no moves left, you
can deal one card to each of the twelve piles.  If the talon
is empty, you can pick up the tableau piles to make a new
talon, and redeal.  Two redeals are allowed.

The foundations with the aces are built up by same suit,
while the foundations with the kings are built down by
same suit.  Cards can be moved between foundations.

The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
