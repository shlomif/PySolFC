<h1>Trumps Row</h1>
<p>
Tarock type. 1 deck. 4 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Group all the cards in sets of 13 cards in ascending sequence
by suit from Two to King, plus one of 22 with the trump of 2 to the
Fool/Skiz.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This solitaire starts with the entire deck shuffled and dealt
out in five rows, four of fourteen cards and one of twenty-two.  The Aces
and one of trumps are then removed making 5 initial free spaces.  You may
move to a space only the card that matches the left neighbor in suit, and
is one greater in rank.  The row of 22 is built in a sequence using the trump
suit, but the other four rows can be built in any suit.  Kings and the
Fool/Skiz are high, so no cards may be placed to their right (they create
dead spaces).
<p>
When no moves can be made, cards still out of sequence are reshuffled
and dealt face up after the ends of the partial sequences, leaving a card
space after each sequence, so that each row looks like a partial sequence
followed by a space, followed by enough cards to make a row of 14 or 22,
depending on the row.  Four redeals are allowed.

<h3>Notes</h3>
