<h1>Usk</h1>
<p>
Klondike type. 1 deck. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
<p>
Just like <a href="somerset.html">Somerset</a>, but
sequences of cards can be moved, only kings can fill empty
piles, and a single redeal is allowed.  With this redeal,
all of the remaining cards on the tableau are shuffled and
a new tableau is dealt.
