<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to eight piles of three cards each, with the
middle card of each pile dealt face-down.  Tableau piles are
built down by color, and face-up cards can be moved regardless
of sequence, though a face-down card or a card with a face-down
card on top of it cannot be moved.  Any card or sequence can be
moved to an empty pile.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal two cards from the
talon to each tableau pile, one face-down then one face-up.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit from ace to king.
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
