<h1>Solitaire Wizard</h1>
<p>
The Solitaire Wizard is a feature in PySol that allows you to create and play
custom solitaire games.  The Solitaire Wizard is an easy way to create custom
games, though its options are a bit limited.  More complex games can be created
with <a href='plugins.html'>plugins</a>.
<p>
Also note that the Solitaire Wizard may not be enabled in mobile versions of
PySol.
<p>
Below are the different options you can set when using the Solitaire Wizard:

<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Initial Setting</b> - The initial setting automatically configures the
Solitaire Wizard options to match one of several sample games.</li>
<li><b>Name</b> - This is the name of the game you wish to create.</li>
<li><b>Skill Level</b> - Whether the game is more luck or skill.  This doesn't
affect the actual game, but is used to categorize it in PySol, and to help
with sorting.</li>
<li><b>Number of Decks</b> - The number of decks used.</li>
<li><b>Layout</b> - The physical layout of the card piles.  This is purely
aesthetic and doesn't affect gameplay.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Talon</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Type</b> - This determines when and how cards are dealt from the talon.
Cards can be dealt either all at the beginning, to a waste pile, reserves, or
foundations, or to the tableau, either in normal style, Spider style (don't allow
dealing from the talon if there are empty piles), or Grounds for a Divorce style
(do not deal to empty tableau piles).</li>
<li><b>Number of Redeals</b> - How many times the player is allowed to redeal.
In each redeal, the pile(s) where the cards from the talon are dealt are
combined to form a new talon.</li>
<li><b># of cards dealt to waste</b> - If dealing cards from the talon to the
waste, this indicates how many are dealt at once.</li>
<li><b>Shuffle during Redeal</b> - Whether the deck should be shuffled when
doing a redeal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Foundations</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Type</b> - This determines what cards can be moved to the foundations.
Foundations can be built by same suit, same color, alternate color,
any suit but the same, rank regardless of suit, or Spider style
(move entire sequences to the foundations once complete).</li>
<li><b>Base Card</b> - Which rank is used to start the foundations - either ace
or king, or any card.</li>
<li><b>Direction</b> - Whether the foundation is built up or down.</li>
<li><b>Move</b> - Whether you're allowed to move the top card from a foundation.</li>
<li><b>First card sets base cards</b> - If the base card is set to any, this
indicates whether all four foundations must start with the same rank - once the
first card is moved to the foundations, all other foundations must start from
the same base rank.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tableau</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Number of tableau piles</b> - How many tableau piles there are.</li>
<li><b>Type</b> - This determines how foundations are built - by same suit,
alternate color, same color, rank regardless of suit, any suit but the same,
up or down, Spider style (can be built regardless of suit, but only sequences
that match the suit option can be moved as a unit), Yukon style (cards can
be moved regardless of sequence), or no building on the tableau allowed.</li>
<li><b>Base Card</b> - What card can fill an empty tableau pile.</li>
<li><b>Direction</b> - Whether the tableau piles are built up or down.</li>
<li><b>Move</b> - Whether sequences can be moved together, or cards can only
be moved singly.</li>
<li><b>Wrapping</b> - Whether wrapping from king to ace or ace to king is
allowed.</li>
<li><b>Use "Super Move" feature</b> - If sequences normally cannot be moved
together, a "Super Move" allows you to move sequences regardless, if there
are enough empty stacks/reserves to make the move normally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reserves</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Number of reserves</b> - How many reserves there are.</li>
<li><b>Max # of accepted cards</b> - How many cards you can move to each
reserve.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opening deal</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Type</b> - How the cards are dealt to the tableau.  Rectangular
deals have the cards dealt relatively evenly, triangular deals involve
each pile getting one more card than the previous, and pyramid deals are
similar, but piles after the center one have one fewer than the previous.</li>
<li><b># of face-down cards dealt to the tableau pile</b> - How many
cards are dealt face-down to each pile.  Note that the top card of
each tableau pile is always face-up.</li>
<li><b># of cards dealt to the reserve</b> - How many cards are dealt
face-up to each reserve.</li>
<li><b>Max # of dealt cards</b> - How many cards can be dealt from the
talon at the start of the game at most.</li>
<li><b>Deal first cards to foundations</b> - Whether the first cards are
dealt to the foundations at the start of the game.</li>
