<h1>Blockade</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Blockade is a solitaire card game which uses two decks of 52 playing cards
each. Akin to solitaire games like Klondike and Gargantua, the object of the
game is play the cards into the eight foundations.
<p>
The game starts with twelve piles, each containing a card (the rest form the
stock). Cards are built down by suit (e.g., 7-6-5-4) and cards or groups of
cards can be moved from one pile to another or to the foundations. The
foundations are built up also by suit, starting from the ace. An empty pile
will be filled up immediately by a card from the stock.
<p>
When all possible moves are done without success, a card is dealt onto each
pile, even with those that have sequences. This and the placing of cards on
empty piles is done until the stock runs out. After that, any card or group of
cards can be placed on any empty space.
<p>
The game is won when all 104 cards are successfully moved to the foundations.
