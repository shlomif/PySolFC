<h1>Capricieuse</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Capricieuse (or Capricious) is a solitaire card game which is played using two
decks of playing cards.
<p>
The entire deck must be dealt into twelve piles of cards. Any arrangement will
do, but for convenience, two rows of six piles each will be form. During
dealing, one Ace and one King of each suit is removed, all of which will form
the foundations. The Aces are built up while the Kings are built down, all by
suit.
<p>
During the process of dealing the twelve piles, cards that can be built on a
foundation must be built. Also, none of the twelve piles should be left out,
i.e. when a card is immediately built on a foundation, the next card is dealt
on the pile the previous card left.
<p>
No building is done during the process of dealing until all cards are dealt.
Afterwards, the top cards of each pile are built on the foundations or on each
other's piles. The cards on the piles are built on each other either up or
down by suit. Building can go on both directions, but a King cannot be placed
over an Ace and vice versa. Only one card can be moved at a time, and any
empty pile can be filled with any card.
<p>
After the player has made all the moves he can make, the piles are collected
in the reverse order the piles are dealt and the process is repeated. This
redeal can be done twice in the game.
<p>
The game is won when all cards end up in the foundations.
