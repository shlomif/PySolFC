<h1>Emperor</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Emperor (or The Emperor) is a solitaire card game which is played using two
decks of playing cards. Its rules are not so clearly explained that it has at
least two versions, one of which is exactly like Rank and File, a variant of
Forty Thieves. But it also one card game that lends itself to "forethough and
much integrity," according to author Peter Arnold.
<p>
The set-up of the tableau is not clearly defined either. The prevalent version
prescribes that forty cards are set up into ten columns of four cards each.
Each column should have its bottom three cards face down and its top card face
up. The three face down cards are collectively known as a "sealed" packet.
<p>
The goal of this game is to put the aces in the foundations as soon as they
are available and build each of them up to kings.
<p>
All the exposed (face-up) cards are available for play, to be built on the
foundations or on other exposed cards on the tableau, and when an face-down
card becomes fully exposed, it is turned face-up. Building in the tableau is
down by alternating color. Some rule sets (like that of Solsuite) allow moving
of packed sequences as a single unit, making it like Rank and File, while
other rule sets (such as that of Pretty Good Solitaire) don't allow moving of
sequences.
<p>
When all possible moves are made, the stock is dealt one at a time. A card
that cannot be played yet onto tableau or on the foundations is placed on the
waste pile, the top card of which is available for play.
<p>
The game ends soon after the stock has run out. The game is won when all cards
are built onto the foundations.
