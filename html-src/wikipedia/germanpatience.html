<h1>German Patience</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
German Patience is a solitaire card game which is played with two decks of
playing cards shuffled together. It is an unusual game because building in the
tableau or playing area is up, as opposed to building down in many others.
Despite its name, it is not known if this game originated from Germany.
<p>
The object of this game is to form eight columns of thirteen cards each. Each
column starts with any card and ends with the card a rank lower than the
first. In this game, building is round-the-corner, i.e. an Ace can be built
over a King and a Deuce (or Two card) can be placed over an Ace.
<p>
At the start of the game, each column in the tableau starts with one card. The
cards in the tableau are built up regardless of suit. Only the top card of
each column is available for play and cards are moved one at a time. Spaces
can be filled with any card.
<p>
When there are no more moves that can be make, the stock is dealt one a time.
Any card that cannot be placed onto the tableau yet is placed on the waste
pile, the top card of which is available for play.
<p>
The game ends soon after the stock has run out (although some rule sets allow
a redeal by picking up the waste pile and turning it face down to make a new
stock). The game is won when all cards are built onto the tableau. It actually
does not matter which card starts each column.
