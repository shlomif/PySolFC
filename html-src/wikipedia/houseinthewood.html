<h1>House in the Woods</h1>

<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
House in the Woods is a solitaire card game with uses two decks of 52 playing
cards each. The game is basically a two-deck version of La Belle Lucie, but it
borrows two things from its cousin Shamrocks. The object of the game is to
place all the cards into eight foundations.
<p>
The cards are dealt in sets of three, resulting in 34 piles, with two cards
left over as a thirty-fifth. The top card of each pile is available for play.
<p>
The cards on the tableau are built either up or down by suit; the player can
have the cards go both directions at the same pile. However, an ace cannot be
placed on a king and vice versa; an ace should be transferred to the
foundations. Furthermore, when a pile becomes empty, it cannot be filled. All
eight foundations are built up in suit starting from aces.
<p>
The game is won when all 104 card end up in the foundations.
<p>
As already mentioned, it is basically a two-deck version of La Belle Lucie.
But the two things that make this game also similar to Shamrocks is the
building the cards up or down and the fact that there are no redeals.

<h3>House on the Hill</h3>
<p>
House on the Hill is another solitaire card game using two decks. It is played
with the same rules as those of House in the Woods except that while the aces,
one of each suit, must occupy four of the eight foundations, the kings, also
one of each suit, must occupy the other four. The aces are built up by suit up
to kings, the kings are built down by suit to aces.
