<h1>Osmosis</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Osmosis (also known as Treasure Trove) is a solitaire game played with a deck
of 52 playing cards where the object, like many solitaire games, is to put the
cards into foundations, although not in numerical order.
<p>
Game play consists of a tableau with four piles of four cards each (one
face-up card on top of three face-down cards). A seventeenth card is put in
the first of four foundations. Cards with the same suit as this card must be
moved to this foundation and the three other foundations must begin with cards
of the same rank. All undealt cards make up the stock.
<p>
The top cards in each pile in the tableau are the only cards in play and must
be moved to the foundations. A card can be moved to a foundation if a card of
the same value has already been placed in the foundation before it. Once cards
have been placed on the foundation, any face-down cards remaining in the
tableau are turned face-up. When placing cards from the tableau is no longer
possible, one can use the stock, deal three cards at a time, and use its top
card to make possible moves. One can redeal the stock as long as there are
possible moves from the stock or from the tableau to the foundations.
<p>
Here's an example (foundations only):
<pre>
<img src="../images/h.gif"> 7 8 10 2 4 9 K A
<img src="../images/s.gif"> 7 A 8 K 9
<img src="../images/d.gif"> 7 8 K
</pre>
<p>
Suppose that from the example above, any heart card can be moved to the top
foundation. One can also place 10<img src="../images/s.gif"> into its
foundation, but one cannot put 2<img src="../images/d.gif"> yet into its
foundation because 2<img src="../images/s.gif"> hasn't turned up yet in its
foundation. No club cannot be placed at this time as the 7<img
src="../images/c.gif"> hasn't appeared.
<p>
The game is won when all cards have been moved to the foundations. But winning
any game can rely on where certain cards are placed in the either one of the
piles in the tableau or in the stock pile. Because of this, finishing a game
of Osmosis is slim if not rare.

<h3>Peek</h3>
<p>
Peek is another solitaire card game using a deck of 52 playing cards. It is
played exactly as Osmosis except all the cards on this game's tableau are
face-up.
