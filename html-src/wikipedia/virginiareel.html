<h1>Virginia Reel</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Virginia Reel is a solitaire card game which uses two decks of 52 playing
cards mixed together. The object of the game is to place all the cards in the
24 foundations.
<p>
First three cards, a 2, a 3, and a 4, are placed vertically. Then, beside each
of the three cards is a row of seven cards. The first card in each row shows
that it is the row for all other cards with the same rank. The first row is
known as the "2s' row," the second row the "3s' row," and the third row the
"4s' row."
<p>
A fourth row of eight cards is dealt. This serves as the reserve with each
card forming a pile.
<p>
The foundations are built up by suit in intervals of three. The table below
shows how.

<p>
To play, a card can be moved to a foundation or to a rightful row from the
other rows or from the reserve. But the player has to bear in mind that when a
card is moved from anywhere in the tableau, <i>the gap it leaves behind must be
filled with a card appropriate for the row where the gap is located</i>. For
instance, when a card has left the 2s' row, the gap it left behind must be
filled with a 2, either from the other rows or from the reserve. This is
especially true at the beginning of the game, where some cards are on each
other's rows like a 4 in the 3s' row and a 3 in the 4s' row. Exchanging cards
to their rightful rows in this case is also possible.
<p>
While the first card in each row is already a foundation in itself and it can
be built on, once a card ends up in its proper row no matter where in the row,
it becomes a foundation itself.
<p>
The top cards in the reserve are in play and can be placed on the foundations,
or be placed on a row (if it is a 2, 3, or 4), but empty piles are not filled
until a new batch of eight cards are dealt every time no more moves are
possible.
<p>
Aces play no part in this game. Any ace that is in the reserve is immediately
discarded. But an ace in any of the rows must be replaced by any applicable
card for that row. So in order to discard an ace from the 2s' row, for
example, a 2 must be available to replace it.
<p>
The game is considered won when all the cards are in foundations, with all
face cards on top.

<h3>Royal Parade</h3>
<p>
Royal Parade is another solitaire card game which is played much the same way
as Virginia Reel. The difference between this game and Virginia Reel is that
in Royal Parade when a card is moved from anywhere in the tableau, <i>the gap
it leaves behind does not have to be filled right away</i>. It can be filled
later by a card appropriate for the row that the gap is located in.
