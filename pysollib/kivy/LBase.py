# kivy EventDispatcher passes keywords, that to not correspond to properties
# to the base classes. Finally they will reach 'object'. With python3 (but not
# python2) 'object' throws an exception 'takes no parameters' in that a
# situation. We therefore underlay a base class (right outside), which
# swallows up remaining keywords. Thus the keywords do not reach 'object' any
# more.
